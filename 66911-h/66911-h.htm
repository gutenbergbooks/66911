together at first, by external opposition, into a serried phalanx, gradually win their
way, become themselves the delight and then the satisfaction of their contemporaries,
and, falling apart as success is secured to them, come to seem lax, effete, and obsolete
to a new race of youths, who effect a fresh æsthetic revolution. In small communities,
these movements are often to be observed more precisely than in larger ones. But they
are very tardily perceived by foreigners, the established authorities in art and literature
retaining their exclusive place in dictionaries and handbooks long after the claim
of their juniors to be observed with attention has been practically conceded at home.
</p>
<p>For this reason, partly, and partly also because the mental life of Holland receives
little attention in this country, no account has yet been taken of the revolution
in Dutch taste which has occupied the last six or seven <span class="pageNum" id="pb.iv">[<a href="#pb.iv">iv</a>]</span>years. I believe that the present occasion is the first on which it has been brought
to the notice of any English-speaking public. There exists, however, in Holland, at
this moment, a group of young writers, most of them between thirty-five and twenty-five
years of age, who exhibit a violent zeal for literature, passing often into extravagance,
who repudiate, sometimes with ferocity, the rather sleepy Dutch authorship of the
last forty years, and who are held together, or crushed together, by the weight of
antiquated taste and indifference to executive merit which they experience around
them. Certain facts seem to be undeniable: first, that every young man of letters
in Holland, whose work is really promising, has joined the camp; and secondly, that,
with all the ferment and crudity inseparable from prose and verse composed in direct
opposition to existing canons of taste, the poems and the stories of these young Dutchmen
are often full of beauty and delicacy. They have read much in their boyhood; they
have imitated Rossetti and Keats; they have been fascinated by certain Frenchmen,
by Flaubert, by Goncourt, particularly by Huysmans, who is a far-away kinsman of their
own; they have studied the disquieting stories of Edgar Poe. But these influences
are passing away, and those who know something of current Dutch <i lang="fr">belles-lettres</i> can realize best how imperatively a ploughing up of the phlegmatic tradition of Dutch
thought was required before a new crop of imagination could spring up.
</p>
<p>Rejecting the conventional aspects of contemporary Dutch literature, I will now attempt
to give some sketch of the present situation as it appears to a foreign critic observing
the field without prejudice. The latest novelist of great importance was Madame Gertrude
Bosboom-Toussaint, who was born in 1821. After having written a long series of historical
romances for nearly forty years, <span class="pageNum" id="pb.v">[<a href="#pb.v">v</a>]</span>this intelligent woman and careful writer broke with her own assured public, and took
up the discussion of psychological questions. She treated the problem of Socialism
in <i lang="nl">Raymond de Schrijnwerker</i> and the status of woman in <i lang="nl">Majoor Frans</i>. Madame Bosboom-Toussaint died in 1886, just too early to welcome the new school
of writers, with whom she would probably have had more sympathy than any of her contemporaries.
Her place in popular esteem was taken for a short time by Miss Opzomer (A.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. Wallis),
whose long novels have been translated into English, <i lang="nl">In dagen van strijd</i> (“In Troubled Times”) and <i lang="nl">Vorstengunst</i> (“Royal Favor”). She had genuine talent, but her style was heavy and tedious. After
the new wind began to blow, although she was still young, she married, went to Hungary,
and gave up writing novels.
</p>
<p>Three authors of importance, each, by a curious coincidence, born in the year 1826,
fill up the interval between the old and new generation. These are Dekker, Busken-Huët,
and Vosmaer. Edward Douwes Dekker, whose novel of <i lang="nl">Max Havelaar</i> dates from 1858, was a man of exceptional genius. Bred in the interior of Java, he
observed the social conditions of life in the Dutch Indies as no one else had done,
but his one great book remained a solitary one. He died in 1887 without having justified
the very high hopes awakened by that extraordinary and revolutionary work. The career
of Konrad Busken-Huët was very different. The principal literary critic of Holland
in his generation, he aimed at being the Sainte-Beuve of the Dutch, and in his early
days, as the dreaded “Thrasybulus” of journalism, he did much to awaken thought. His
volumes of criticism are extremely numerous, and exercised a wholesome influence during
his own time. He died in Paris in April, 1886. These two writers have had a strong
effect on the prose style of the younger school of <span class="pageNum" id="pb.vi">[<a href="#pb.vi">vi</a>]</span>essayists and novelists. They lived long enough to observe the dawn of the new literature,
and their relations with the latest writers were cordial if somewhat reserved.
</p>
<p>What Douwes Dekker and Busken-Huët did in prose, was effected in poetry by Carel Vosmaer.
This estimable man, who died in 1888, was well known throughout Europe as an art-critic
and an authority on Rembrandt. In Holland he was pre-eminent as the soul of a literary
newspaper, the <i lang="nl">Nederlandsche Spectator</i>, which took an independent line in literary criticism, and affected to lead public
taste in directions less provincial and old-fashioned than the rest of the Dutch press.
Vosmaer wrote also several volumes of more or less fantastic poetry, a translation
of Homer into alexandrines, and an antiquarian novel, <i lang="nl">Amazone</i>, 1881. But Vosmaer’s position was, above all, that of a precursor. He, and he alone,
saw that a new thing must be made in Dutch poetical literature. He, and he alone,
was not satisfied with the stereotyped Batavian tradition. At the same time Vosmaer
was not, it may be admitted, strong enough himself to found a new school; perhaps
even, in his later days, the Olympian calm which he affected, and a certain elegant
indolence which overcame him, may have made him unsympathetic to the ardent and the
juvenile. At all events, this singular phenomenon has occurred. He who of all living
Dutchmen was, ten or fifteen years ago, fretting under the poverty of thought and
imagination in his fatherland and longing for the new era to arrive, is at this moment
the one man of the last generation who is most exposed to that unseemly <i lang="fr">ferocité des jeunes</i> which is the ugliest feature of these æsthetic revolutions. I have just been reading,
with real pain, the violent attack on Vosmaer and his influence which has been published
by that very clever young poet, Mr. Willem Kloos (<i lang="nl">De Nieuwe Gids</i>, December, <span class="pageNum" id="pb.vii">[<a href="#pb.vii">vii</a>]</span>1890). All that cheers me is to know that the whirligig of time will not forget its
revenges, and that, if Mr. Kloos only lives long enough, he will find somebody, now
unborn, to call <i>him</i> a “bloodless puppet.”
</p>
<p>Of one other representative of the transitional period, Marcellus Emants, I need say
little. He wrote a poem, <i>Lilith</i>, and several short stories. Much was expected of him, but I know not what has been
the result.
</p>
<p>The inaugurator of the new school was Jacques Perk, a young poet of indubitable genius,
who was influenced to some degree by Shelley, and by the <i>Florence</i> of the Dutch Browning, Potgieter. He wrote in 1880 a <i>Mathilde</i>, for which he could find no publisher, presently died, and began to be famous on
the posthumous issue of his poems, edited by Vosmaer and Kloos, in 1883.
</p>
<p>The sonnets of Perk, like those of Bowles with us a hundred years ago, were the heralds
of a whole new poetic literature. The resistance made to the young writers who now
began to express themselves, and their experience that all the doors of periodical
publication in Holland were closed to them, led to the foundation in 1885 of <i lang="nl">De Nieuwe Gids</i>, a rival to the old Dutch quarterly, <i lang="nl">De Gids</i>. In this new review, which has steadily maintained and improved its position, most
of the principal productions of the new school have appeared. The first three numbers
contained <i lang="nl">De Kleine Johannes</i> (“Little Johnny”), of Dr. Frederik van Eeden, the first considerable prose-work of
the younger generation. This is a charming romance, fantastic and refined, half symbolical,
half realistic, which deserves to be known to English readers. It has been highly
appreciated in Holland. To this followed two powerful books by L. van Deyssel, <i lang="nl">Een Liefde</i> (“A Love”) and <i lang="nl">De Kleine Republiek</i> (“The Little Republic”). Van Deyssel has written with great force, but he has hitherto
been the <span class="pageNum" id="pb.viii">[<a href="#pb.viii">viii</a>]</span><i lang="fr">enfant terrible</i> of the school, the one who has claimed with most insolence to say precisely what
has occurred to him to say. He has been influenced, more than the rest, by the latest
French literature.
</p>
<p>While speaking of the new school, it is difficult to restrain from mentioning others
of those whose work in <i lang="nl">De Nieuwe Gids</i> and elsewhere has raised hopes of high performance in the future. Jacques van Looy,
a painter by profession, has published, among other things, an exquisitely finished
volume of <i lang="nl">Proza</i> (“Prose Essays”). Frans Netscher, who deliberately marches in step with the French
realists, is the George Moore of Holland; he has published a variety of small sketches
and one or two novels. Ary Prins, under the pseudonym of Coopland, has written some
very good studies of life. Among the poets are Willem Kloos, Albert Verwey, and Herman
Gorter, each of whom deserves a far more careful critical consideration than can here
be given to him.
</p>
<p>Willem Kloos, indeed, may be considered as the leader of the school since the death
of Perk. It was to Kloos that, in the period from 1880 to 1885, each of the new writers
went in secret for encouragement, criticism, and sympathy. He appears to be a man
of very remarkable character. Violent and passionate in his public utterances, he
is adored by his own colleagues and disciples, and one of the most gifted of them
has told me that “Kloos has never made a serious mistake in his estimate of the force
of a man or of a book.” His writings, however, are very few, and his tone in controversy
is acrid and uncompromising, as I have already indicated. He remains the least known
and the least liked, though the most powerful, of the band. The member of the new
generation whose verse and prose alike have won most acceptance is, certainly, Frederik
van Eeden. His cycle of lyrical verse, <span class="pageNum" id="pb.ix">[<a href="#pb.ix">ix</a>]</span><i>Ellen</i>, 1891, is doubtless the most exquisite product of recent Dutch literature.
</p>
<p>For the peculiar quality which unites in one movement the varied elements of the school
which I have attempted thus briefly to describe, the name Sensitivism has been invented
by one of themselves, by Van Deyssel. It is a development of impressionism, grafted
upon naturalism, as a frail and exotic bud may be set in the rough basis of a thorn.
It preserves the delicacy of sensation of the one and strengthens it by the exactitude
and conscientiousness of the other, yet without giving way to the vagaries of impressionism
or to the brutality of mere realism. It selects and refines, it re-embraces Fancy,
that maiden so rudely turned out of house and home by the naturalists; it aims, in
fact, at retaining the best, and nothing but the best, of the experiments of the French
during the last quarter of a century.
</p>
<p>Van Deyssel greets <i lang="fr">L’Argent</i> with elaborate courtesy, with the respect due to a fallen divinity. He calls his
friends in Holland to attend the gorgeous funeral of naturalism, which is dead; but
urges them not to sacrifice their own living Sensitivism to the imitation of what
is absolutely a matter of past history. It will be seen that Dutch Sensitivism is
not by any means unlike French Symbolism, and we might expect prose like Mallarmé’s
and verse like Moréas’s! As a matter of fact, however, the Dutch seem, in their general
attitude of reserve, to leave their mother-tongue unassailed, and to be as intelligible
as their inspiration allows them to be.
</p>
<p>To one of these writers, however, and to one of the youngest, it is time that I should
turn. The first member of the new Dutch school to be presented, in the following pages,
to English readers, is Louis Marie Anne Couperus. Of him, as the author of this book,
I must give a fuller <span class="pageNum" id="pb.x">[<a href="#pb.x">x</a>]</span>biography, although he is still too young to occupy much space by the record of his
achievements. Louis Couperus was born on the 10th of June, 1863, at the Hague, where
he spent the first ten years of his life. He was then taken in company with his family
to Java, and resided five years in Batavia. Returning to the Hague, where he completed
his education, he began to make teaching his profession, but gradually drifted into
devoting himself entirely to literature. He published a little volume of verses in
1884, and another, of more importance, called <i lang="nl"><span class="corr" id="xd31e273" title="Source: Orchideïen">Orchideeën</span></i> (“Orchids”), in 1887, Oriental and luscious. But he has succeeded, as every one allows,
much better in prose. His long novel of modern life in the Hague, called <i>Eline Vere</i>, is an admirable performance. Of <i lang="nl">Noodlot</i> (literally to be translated “Fate” or “Destiny”) our readers will judge for themselves
at a later date. Such is the brief chronicle of a writer from whom much is expected
by the best critics of his own country.

<p class="first">They were close to each other in the dining-room, which had been turned into a dressing-room.
In front of a mirror stood Frédérique van Erlevoort, with her hair hanging loose,
looking very pale under a thin layer of powder, her eyebrows blackened with a single
stroke of the pencil.
</p>
<p>“Do hurry up, Paul! We shall never get ready,” she said, a little impatiently, glancing
at the clock.
</p>
<p>Paul van Raat was kneeling at her feet, and his fingers draped a long thin veil of
crimson and gold in folds from her waist. The gauze hung like a cloud over the pinkness
of her skirt; her neck and arms, white as snow with the powder, were left free, and
sparkled with the glitter of the chains and necklaces strung across one another.
</p>
<p>“Whew, what a draught! Do keep the door shut, Dien!” Paul shouted to an old servant
who was leaving the room with her arms full of dresses. Through the open door one
could see the guests—men in evening dress, ladies in light costumes: they passed along
the azaleas and palms in the corridor into the large drawing-room; they smiled at
the sight of the old servant, and threw surreptitious glances into the dining-room.
</p>
<p>They all laughed at this look behind the scenes. Frédérique alone remained serious,
realizing that she had the dignity of a princess of antiquity to keep up.
</p>
<p>“Do make haste, Paul!” she pleaded. “It’s past half-past eight already!”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Yes, yes, Freddie, don’t get nervous; you’re finished,” he answered, and adroitly
pinned a few jewels among the gauze folds of her draperies.
</p>
<p>“Ready?” asked Marie and Lili Verstraeten, coming out of the room where the stage
had been fixed up, a mysterious elevation almost effaced in semi-darkness.
</p>
<p>“Ready,” answered Paul. “And now calmly, please,” he continued, raising his voice
and looking round with an air of command.
</p>
<p>The warning was well needed. The three boys and the five girls who did duty as ladies’-maids,
were rushing about the room laughing, shouting, creating the greatest disorder. In
vain Lili tried to save a gilt cardboard lyre from the hands of the son of the house,
a boy twelve years old, while their two rascally cousins were just on the point of
climbing up a great white cross, which stood in a corner, and was already yielding
under their onslaughts.
</p>
<p>“Get away from that cross, Jan and Karel! Give up that lyre, you other!” roared Paul.
“Do look after them, Marie. And now, Bet and Dien, come here; Bet with the lamp, Dien
at the door; all the rest out of the road! There’s no more room; look on from the
garden through the window of the big drawing-room; you’ll see everything beautifully,
at a distance. Come along, Freddie, carefully, here’s your train.”
</p>
<p>“You’ve forgotten my crown.”
</p>
<p>“I’ll put it on when you’re posed. Come on.”
</p>
<p>The three girls hurried to get away, the boys squatted in a corner of the room, where
they could not be seen, and Paul helped Freddie to climb on to the stage.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Marie, who, like Lili, was not yet draped, talked through the closed window with the
fireman, who was waiting, muffled up, in the snowy garden, to let off the Bengal light.
A great reflector stared through the window like a pale, lustreless sun.
</p>
<p>“First white, then green, then red,” Marie called out, and the fireman nodded.
</p>
<p>The now deserted dressing-room was dark, barely lit by the lamp which Bet held in
her hand, while Dien stood at the door.
</p>
<p>“Carefully, Freddie, carefully,” said Paul.
</p>
<p>Frédérique sank down gently into the cushions of the couch; Paul arranged her draperies,
her chains, her hair, her diadem, and placed a flower here and there.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Will that do?” she asked with tremulous voice, taking up the pose she had studied
beforehand.
</p>
<p>“You’re delicious; beautiful! Now then, Marie, Lili, come here.”
</p>
<p>Lili threw herself on the floor, Marie leaned against the couch with her head at Frédérique’s
feet. Paul draped both girls quickly in coloured shawls and veils, and twisted strings
of gems round their arms and in their hair.
</p>
<p>“Marie and Lili, look as if you were in despair. Wring your hands more than that,
Lili! More despair, much more despair! Freddie, more languishing, turn your eyes up,
set your mouth in a sadder expression.”
</p>
<p>“Like that?”
</p>
<p>Marie screamed.
</p>
<p>“Yes, that will do! That’s better; now be quiet, Marie. Is everything ready?”
</p>
<p>“Ready!” said Marie.
</p>
<p>Paul arranged one or two more things, a crease, a flower, doubtful whether everything
was right.
</p>
<p>“Come, let’s start,” said Lili, who was in a very uncomfortable position.
</p>
<p>“Bet, take away the lamps; Dien, shut that door, and then come here, both of you,
one on each side of the folding doors of the big room.”
</p>
<p>They were all in the dark, with beating hearts, while Paul tapped at the window, and
joined the boys in the corner.
</p>
<p>Slowly and doubtfully the Bengal light flamed up against the reflector, the folding
doors opened solemnly, a clear white glow lit up the tableau.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Smiling and bowing, while the conversation suddenly changed into a muffled murmur,
the guests pressed forward into the large drawing-room and the conservatory, blinded
by a burst of light and colour. Men got out of the way of a couple of laughing girls.
In the background boys climbed on the chairs.
</p>
<p>“The death of Cleopatra!” Betsy van Raat read out to Mrs. Van Erlevoort, who had handed
her the programme.
</p>
<p>“Splendid! magnificent!” one heard on every side.
</p>
<p>Ancient Egypt seemed to have come alive again in the white glow of the light. Between
luxurious draperies something like an <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>oasis could be perceived, a blue sky, two pyramids, some palms. On her couch, supported
by sphinxes, lay Cleopatra, at the point of death, an adder curling round her arm.
Two slaves were prostrate in despair at her feet. The parti-coloured vision of oriental
magnificence lasted a few seconds; the poetry of antiquity revived under the eyes
of a modern audience.
</p>
<p>“That’s Freddie,” said Betsy. “How lovely!” and she pointed out the dying queen to
Mrs. Van Erlevoort, who was dazzled by all this luxury. Now, however, the mother recognized
her daughter in the beautiful motionless statue lying before her.
</p>
<p>“And that’s Marie, and the other—oh, that’s Lili—irrecognizable! What beautiful costumes!
how elaborate! You see that dress of Lili’s, violet and silver? I lent her that.”
</p>
<p>“How well they do it,” murmured the old lady.
</p>
<p>The white glow of the light began to flicker, the doors were closed.
</p>
<p>“Splendid, auntie, splendid!” Betsy cried, as Mrs. Verstraeten, the hostess, passed
her.
</p>
<p>Twice the tableau was recalled, first in a flood of sea-green, then in fiery red.
Freddie, with her adder, lay immovable, and only Lili quivered in her forced attitude.
Paul looked out from his corner with a beaming face; everything was going well.
</p>
<p>“How quiet Freddie lies! And everything is so rich, and yet not overdone. Something
like a picture of Makart’s,” said Betsy, opening her feather fan.
</p>
<p>“Your daughter is tired of life very early, madam,” lisped young de Woude van Bergh,
bowing towards Mrs. van Erlevoort, Freddie’s mother.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>After the third repetition of the tableau Mrs. Verstraeten went to the dressing-room.
She found Frédérique and Lili laughing while they got out of their Egyptian attire,
looking for endless pins in every fold. Paul and Marie stood on the steps, and, lighted
by two of the servants, pulled Cleopatra’s dress to pieces. Dien fussed about, picking
up the dropped draperies and the fallen chains. The three boys rolled over one another
on a mattress.
</p>
<p>“Was it pretty, mamma?” cried Lili.
</p>
<p>“Was it pretty, madam?” cried Frédérique, at the same time.
</p>
<p>“Beautiful! They would have liked to see it again.”
</p>
<p>“What again! I’m nearly dead already,” cried Lili; and she <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>tumbled into an arm-chair, throwing a great bundle off it upon the floor. Dien gave
way to despair; at that rate she would never get done.
</p>
<p>“Lili, rest yourself,” cried Paul, from the top of his steps in the other room; “you’ll
get tired in that attitude. Aunt Verstraeten, tell Lili to rest herself,” and he threw
some coloured carpets off the cords on which they had been hanging. Dien went on folding
up.
</p>
<p>“Dien, white sheets and white tulle this way, quick,” cried Marie. Dien misunderstood
her, and came back with the wrong article.
</p>
<p>Then all began to talk at once, and every one asked for something else, and there
arose a very Babel of confusion. At the top of the staircase Paul made a gesture of
despair, but no one took any notice.
</p>
<p>“I am utterly worn out!” said he, crouching down in impotent rage. “No one does anything.
It all falls to my lot!”
</p>
<p>Madame Verstraeten, having in her turn begged Lili to rest herself, had gone to tell
the servants not to forget the youthful artistes. As a result, the men soon came in,
carrying big trays laden with glasses of wine and lemonade, pastry and sandwiches.
The confusion only increased. The three boys were served with various good things
on their mattress, over which one of the servants spilt a stream of lemonade. Up flew
Marie, in a torrent of rage, and with Dien’s assistance quickly pulled the mattress
away from under the boys, into the next room.
</p>
<p>“Frédérique, do give a hand there,” cried Paul, in a voice shrill with irritation.
As for keeping any further sort of control over the three lads, <i>that</i> he had given up as hopeless. Ere long, however, the noisy young customers were driven,
loudly shrieking and stumbling one over another, out of the room by Dien.
</p>
<p>Then there was a little more quietness, but everybody was doing something, except
Lili.
</p>
<p>“There’s a muddle!” she muttered to herself. Then she sat down and brushed her hair,
wavy and <i lang="fr">blond cendré</i>, and that done, she took up her powder-puff, and sprinkled a snowy layer over her
arms.
</p>
<p>Dien returned, very much out of breath, shaking her head, and with a kindly smile
on her face.
</p>
<p>“Dien, white sheets and tulle quickly,” Freddie, Marie, and Paul <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>all cried together. Paul came down from his place on the stairs, placed the big cross,
the weight of which nearly crushed him, on the platform, and at the foot he laid the
mattress and a snug arrangement of pillows.
</p>
<p>“Dien, white sheets and tulle; all the tulle and muslin you can find.”
</p>
<p>And Dien and the other servants brought it, one soft mass of white.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Madame Verstraeten sat down beside her niece, Betsy van Raat. She was married to Paul’s
elder brother.
</p>
<p>“What a pity Eline is not here! I had so depended on her to fill up the long intervals
with a little music. She sings so nicely.”
</p>
<p>“She was really not feeling well, aunt. She is very sorry, you may be sure, that she
can’t be here, in honour of uncle’s birthday.”
</p>
<p>“What is the matter with her?”
</p>
<p>“I don’t quite know. Nerves, I think.”
</p>
<p>“She really ought not to give herself up to these fits. With a little energy she could
easily get over that nervousness.”
</p>
<p>“Well, you see, aunt, this nervousness is the modern bane of young women, it is the
<i lang="fr">fin de siècle</i> epidemic,” said Betsy, with a faint smile.
</p>
<p>Madame Verstraeten sighed and nodded.
</p>
<p>“By the bye,” said she, “I suppose the girls will be too tired to-morrow evening to
go to the opera. Would you care to have our box?”
</p>
<p>Betsy reflected for a moment.
</p>
<p>“I have a little dinner to-morrow, aunt; but still I should like the box. It is only
the Ferelyns and Emilie and Georges who are coming, but the Ferelyns are going early
because little Dora is not well, so I could easily go with Emilie and Georges, and
be in time to see an act.”
</p>
<p>“Well, that is settled then. I shall send you the tickets,” said Madame Verstraeten
rising.
</p>
<p>Betsy rose too. George de Woude van Bergh was just about to speak to her, but she
took no notice. She thought him a terrible bore that evening; he had spoken to her
twice, and each time said the same thing, something about the tableaux. No; there
was no conversation in him at all. And to-morrow night too she would have to meet
him again; what an enjoyable prospect! Aunt’s box <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>was quite a godsend. There stood her husband, in the conservatory, together with some
gentlemen, Mr. Verstraeten, Mr. Hovel, Otto and Etienne van Erlevoort, they talking
and he listening, his heavy body crushing the leaves of a palm, a somewhat stupid
smile playing about his expressionless, good-humoured face. Oh, how he bored her!
She thought him insufferable. And what a figure he cut in a dress coat! In his great-coat
at all events he had a manly appearance.
</p>
<p>Walking towards him she said, “Do say something to somebody, Henk. You look like a
fixture in that corner there. Can’t you move? you <i>do</i> appear to enjoy yourself. Your necktie is all on one side.”
</p>
<p>He muttered something and fumbled about his neck. She turned away and was soon at
her ease in the midst of a noisy little group. Even melancholy Madame van Ryssel,
Freddie’s sister, formed one of them. Emilie de Woude was unmarried and bore her thirty-eight
years with an enviable grace: her pleasant, animate features charmed all who met her.
She was much like her younger brother George, but about her there was something genial—a
great contrast to his studied ceremoniousness.
</p>
<p>Attracted by her amusing anecdotes, Emilie sat, the central figure in a joyous little
group. She was just telling them of her recent fall on a patch of frozen snow, at
the feet of a gentleman who had remained motionless, staring at her, instead of helping
her to her feet.
</p>
<p>“Just fancy my muff on the left, my hat on the right, myself in the centre, and right
in front of me a man staring at me with open-mouthed amazement.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>There was the tinkling of a bell; Emilie broke off her story and ran away from her
audience. The folding doors were opened, and there was a general rush to the front.
</p>
<p>“I can’t see at all,” said Emilie, rising on tiptoe.
</p>
<p>“Come here on my chair, miss,” cried a young girl behind her.
</p>
<p>“You are a little dear, Toos, really. Will you allow me to pass by, Madame van der
Stoor? your daughter has come to my aid.”
</p>
<p>Madame van der Stoor, who, under a pseudonym, dabbled much in poetry, moved a step
back, with an acrid smile about her lips. She felt a little disgusted at Emilie’s
<i lang="fr">sans-gêne</i>; she herself never <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>made an attempt to get a better view, it was not the thing to show an unfashionable
interest in the entertainment.
</p>
<p>Emilie and Cateau van der Stoor were soon standing on one chair, holding each other’s
waists.
</p>
<p>“Oh, how pretty!” cried Emilie, and then remained silent in rapt attention. From out
of the billows of a foaming sea arose a rough-hewn cross of marble whiteness, round
the base of which a fragile fair woman clung in mortal agony, whilst a heaving wave
of tulle covered her feet; and with the fierceness of despair her slender fingers
grasped the Rock of Ages.
</p>
<p>“It is Lili,” was heard here and there.
</p>
<p>“How graceful she is, that Lili!” whispered Emilie to Cateau. “But how can she hang
there like that? How can she bear it so long?”
</p>
<p>“She is surrounded with pillows; but still it must be very tiring,” said Toos. “Of
course you can’t see anything of the pillows, miss.”
</p>
<p>“Of course not. But it is very nice; I have never seen anything so poetic before.…
Say, Toos, I thought you were going to take part?”
</p>
<p>“So I am, but only in the last tableau, with Etienne van Erlevoort. I shall have to
be going soon to dress.”
</p>
<p>Quickly she got down from her chair. The light grew dim, the folding doors were closed.
Applause rang throughout the room. But ere long the white vision of surging foam was
repeated, and an angel hovered over the cross, and held out her hand to the swooning
woman.
</p>
<p>Stronger and stronger grew the applause.
</p>
<p>“Of course Marie cannot keep a serious face again,” said Emilie, shaking her head.
“She will burst out laughing in a moment.”
</p>
<p>And really something like a smile seemed to be trembling about the little mouth of
the angel, the nervous twitching of the eyebrows contrasting very oddly with the pathetic
expression of her features.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Although it was evident enough that the artistes were tired, not one of them being
able to remain perfectly motionless, the last tableau was received with enthusiastic
cheers. It was encored again and again. The tableau consisted of an allegorical representation
of the Five Senses, the parts being taken by the four young girls, attired in rich
dresses—cloth of gold, brocade ermine<span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>—and by Etienne, Frédérique’s youngest brother, who, in the garb of a minstrel, represented
the sense of Hearing.
</p>
<p>The tableaux were concluded.
</p>
<p>It was now two o’clock, and Mr. and Madame Verstraeten received the thanks of their
guests as they left them.
</p>
<p>“Do you remain to supper with Cateau?” said Madame Verstraeten to Madame van der Stoor;
“quite <i lang="fr">sans cérémonie</i>, you know.”
</p>
<p>Madame van der Stoor, however, feared it was too late; she would just wait for her
daughter.
</p>
<p>The artistes who had doffed their costumes entered the room and were overwhelmed with
the thanks of those guests still remaining, while Emilie played a march on the piano.
As an intimate friend she stayed to supper with van Raat and Betsy.
</p>
<p>“You are coming to-morrow, are you not, Toos? the photographer is coming at two,”
said Marie.
</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Cateau, “I shall be here.”
</p>
<p>Utterly worn out, the artistes flung themselves down in the comfortable chairs in
the conservatory, where a dainty little supper was served.
</p>
<p>“What was prettiest? What was prettiest?” all cried together
</p>
<p>Then there was a general expression of opinion, to the accompaniment of clattering
plates and forks, and the jingling of glasses.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was half-past two when the van Raats returned from the supper to the Nassauplein.
At their house all was in darkness. While Henk drew the bolt across the door Betsy
thought she would take a look at her sleeping boy, snugly ensconced in his little
white cot up-stairs. She took up her candle and went up-stairs, whilst he, laden with
papers, walked into the breakfast-room, where the gas was still burning.
</p>
<p>Arrived in her dressing-room, she removed her cloak from her shoulders. In the small
grate the flame curled upward like the fiery tongue of a dragon. There was something
indefinably soothing <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>in the atmosphere of the room, something like a warm vapour, mingled with the sweet
faint odour of violets. After giving a glance at her child, she sat down with a sigh
of fatigue, in an arm-chair. Then the door opened, and Eline, in a dressing-gown of
white flannel, her hair falling in thick waves down her back, entered.
</p>
<p>“What, Elly, not in bed yet?”
</p>
<p>“No, I—have been reading. Did you enjoy yourself?”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes, it was very nice. I only wish that Henk had not been such an awful bore.
He never said a word, and with his stupid face he sat there fumbling at his watch-chain
until he could go and take his hand at whist.”
</p>
<p>Then with a somewhat angry movement Betsy kicked her dainty little shoes from her
feet.
</p>
<p>Eline sighed languidly.
</p>
<p>“Did you tell Madame Verstraeten that I was not well?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; but you know when I come home at night I like to go to bed. We can talk to-morrow,
eh?”
</p>
<p>Eline knew that her sister when she returned home at night was always more or less
irritable. Still she was tempted to give her a sharp answer, but she felt too unnerved
for it. With her lips she lightly touched Betsy’s cheek, and quite unconsciously laid
her head on her sister’s shoulder, in a sudden and irresistible longing for tenderness.
</p>
<p>“Are you really ill, eh, or——?”
</p>
<p>“No. Only a little—lazy. Good-night.”
</p>
<p>“Pleasant dreams!”
</p>
<p>Eline retired with languid steps. Betsy proceeded to undress.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Arrived in the hall, Eline experienced the uncomfortable feeling of having been an
unwelcome visitor to her sister. All the evening, giving herself up entirely to a
fit of indolence, she had been in solitude, and now she longed for company. For a
moment she stood undecided in the dark corridor, and then carefully feeling her way
she descended the stairs and entered the breakfast-room.
</p>
<p>Henk, divested of his coat, stood by the mantelpiece in his shirt-sleeves, preparing
his grog, by way of night-cap, and the hot fumes of the liquor filled the room.
</p>
<p>“Hallo, girl, is that you?” he said, in a jovial tone, whilst in his sleepy blue-gray
eyes and about his heavily fair-bearded mouth <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>there played a good-humoured smile. “Did you not feel terribly bored, left to yourself
all the evening?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; just a little. Perhaps you did even more?” she asked with a pleasant smile.
</p>
<p>“I? Not at all. The tableaux were very pretty.”
</p>
<p>Then with his back leaning against the mantelpiece he began sipping his grog.
</p>
<p>“Has the youngster been good?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; he has been asleep. Are you not going to bed?”
</p>
<p>“I just want to look at the papers. But why are you still up?”
</p>
<p>“Oh—just because——” With a languid, graceful movement she stretched her arms, and
then twisted her heavy locks into a glossy brown coil. She felt the need to speak
to him without constraint, but the words would not come, and not the faintest thought
could she conjure up to take shape within her dreamy mind. Gladly would she have burst
into tears, not because of any poignant sorrow, but for the mere longing of hearing
his deep solacing tones in comforting her. But she could find no words to give expression
to her feelings, and again she stretched forth her arms in languid grace.
</p>
<p>“Is anything wrong, eh, old girl? Come, tell me what it is.”
</p>
<p>With a vacant stare she shook her head. No, there was nothing to tell.
</p>
<p>“Come, you can tell me all about it, you know that.”
</p>
<p>“Oh—I feel a little miserable.”
</p>
<p>“What about?”
</p>
<p>Then with a pretty little pout, “Oh—I don’t know. I have been a little nervous all
day.”
</p>
<p>He laughed—his usual soft, sonorous laugh.
</p>
<p>“You and your nerves! Come, sis, cheer up. You are such good company when you are
not so melancholy; you must not give yourself over to these fits.” He felt conscious
that his eloquence would not hold out to argue the matter further, so with a laugh
he concluded, “Will you have a drop of grog, sis?”
</p>
<p>“Thank you—yes, just a sip out of your glass.”
</p>
<p>She turned to him, and laughing in his fair beard, he raised the steaming glass to
her lips. Through the half-closed eyelids he saw a tear glistening, but she kept it
back. All at once, with sudden determination, he set down his glass and grasped her
hands.
</p>
<p>“Come, girl, tell me; there is something—something has occurred <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>with Betsy, or—come now, you generally trust me.” And he gave her a reproachful glance
with his sleepy, kindly, stupid eyes, like those of a faithful sheep-dog.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then in a voice broken with sobs, she burst forth in a stream of lamentations, though
without apparent cause. It was her heart’s inmost cry for a little tenderness and
sympathy. What was her life to her? to whom could she be of the slightest use? Wringing
her hands, she walked up and down the room sobbing and lamenting. What would she care
did she die within the hour? it was all the same to her—only that aimless, useless
existence, without anything to which she could devote her whole soul; that alone was
no longer bearable.
</p>
<p>Henk contradicted her, feeling certainly somewhat abashed at the scene, which for
the rest was but a repetition of so many previous ones. To give a new turn to her
thoughts he began to talk about Betsy, and Ben their boy, about himself—he was even
about to allude to a future home of her own, but he could not bring it so far. She
on her part shook her head like a sulking child, which, not getting what it wants,
refuses to take anything else, and with a passionate movement she all at once threw
her head on his shoulder, and with an arm round his bull-dog neck, she burst into
a fresh torrent of sobs. Thus she went on lamenting in wild and incoherent words,
her nerves overstrained by the evening’s solitude and the hours of brooding in her
over-heated room. Over and over again she reverted to her aimless life, which she
dragged along like a wretched burden, and in her voice there was something like a
reproach to him, her brother-in-law. He, confused and deeply touched by the warmth
of her embrace, which he certainly could scarcely return with such tenderness, could
find nothing to stem that wild torrent of incoherent sentences but a few common-places.
</p>
<p>Slowly, softly, like rose-leaves falling gently on the limpid bosom of a summer stream,
she let her melancholy broodings glide away on the full low tones of his deep voice.
</p>
<p>At length she stopped and heaved a sigh, but her head still rested on his shoulder.
Now that she was somewhat calmer, he thought it right to show a little anger at her
behaviour. What a folly it was, to be sure! What stupidity! What a fuss to get into
about nothing!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p>“No, Henk, really——” she began, and lifted her tear-stained face to his.
</p>
<p>“My dear girl, what rubbish you talk about your aimless life, and all that sort of
thing. What puts those things into your head? We are all fond of you——” and remembering
his unspoken thought of before, he proceeded, “A young girl like you—talking about
an aimless——Sis, you are mad!”
</p>
<p>Then, as though tickled at the thought, and besides, thinking that the philosophic
condition had lasted long enough, he suddenly gave her arm a sharp twist, and pinched
her about the pouting lips. Laughingly she resisted; his movement had somewhat restored
to her her broken equilibrium.
</p>
<p>When a few moments later both went up-stairs together, she could scarcely restrain
herself from bursting out in laughter, as he suddenly lifted her up in his arms to
carry her, while she, fearing he would stumble, in a voice half beseeching, half commanding,
said—
</p>
<p>“Come, Henk, let me go; do you hear? Don’t be so foolish! Henk, let go!”

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Eline Vere was the younger of the two sisters, darker of hair and eyes, slenderer,
with a figure less maturely developed. Her deeply-shaded dark brown eyes, and the
ivory pallor of her complexion, together with the languor of some of her movements,
gave her somewhat of the dreamy nature of an odalisk of the harem. The beauty with
which she had been endowed, she prized like a precious jewel, and indeed she was at
times half intoxicated with the glamour of her own fascinations. For several moments
at a time she could stand looking at her own image in the glass, her rosy-tipped fingers
gently stroking the delicate arch of the eyebrow or the long silken lashes, or arranging
the wealth of brown hair about her head, in the wild luxuriance of a gay <i>gitana</i>. Her toilet afforded her endless employment, continuous and earnest meditation, in
testing the effects, harmonious or otherwise, of the softened tints of satins, and
the warmer colourings of plush, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>the halo of tulle and gauze, muslin and lace, that surrounded it all. In short, everything
about her, from the faint clinging odour of violets, to the shimmer of soft draperies,
was full of refined, charming suggestion.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Somewhat dreamy and romantic by nature, there were times when, in a fit of languor,
she thought with a certain lingering regret of her childhood, recalling to mind all
sorts of memories of those days, and treasuring them up like so many precious relics.
It was then that consciously or unconsciously she imparted a fresh colour of sentiment
to those faded recollections of days gone by. In this way, the most trivial episode
of her childhood became idealized and suffused with a charm of poetry. Betsy, with
her practical turn of mind, never missed an opportunity rightly or wrongly to discount
anything that bore but the faintest resemblance to idealism; and Eline, in her transient
state of half happiness, half melancholy, usually succeeded, after her sister’s practical
demonstrations, in distinguishing the actual state of things from the luxuriant fantasies
conjured up by her own imagination.
</p>
<p>At times her memory went back to her father, a painter, of refined and artistic temperament,
elegant, but without the strength of a creative faculty, married whilst but a youth
to a woman many years his senior, and by far his superior in strength of will and
individuality. To her master hand, his pliant nature readily yielded, for his was
a fine-strung temperament which, like the chords of a precious instrument, would have
trembled under her rude touch, just as that of Eline sometimes trembled under the
touch of her sister. She recalled to mind that father, with his complexion of yellow
ivory, and his bloodless transparent fingers, lying down in listless languor, his
active brain thinking out some great creation, only to be cast aside after the first
few touches of the brush. Her he had often made his confidante, and the trust he placed
in her caused her childish nature to regard him with a mixture of affectionate devotion
and worshipful reverence, so that in her eyes he assumed the appearance of a poetical,
dreamy-eyed, long-haired Rafael. Her mother, on the other hand, had always inspired
her with a certain amount of fear, and the remembrance of the disillusionizing trivialities
of daily life, with which the figure of her mother became inseparably interwoven,
rendered it impossible for Eline to idealize her in her thoughts.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>She remembered, after the death of her father, at a still early age, but still after
many years of half-hearted effort and dismal failures, and after the demise of her
mother, felled by a sudden attack of heart disease, spending the days of her early
girlhood under the guardianship of a widowed aunt. Old-fashioned, reserved and prim,
with saddened regular features, the ruins of a once beautiful woman, she well remembered
those two bony hands in perpetual motion over four bright glistening knitting-needles.
There she lived, in that big room, in nerveless ease and placid luxury, in a paradise
of cosy comfort, amid a wealth of soft draperies and carpets, and all that was pleasing
and soothing to the senses.
</p>
<p>The two sisters growing up side by side under the same training, under the same surroundings,
developed within themselves a somewhat similar mental and moral condition, which,
however, as years went by followed the bent of their different temperaments. In Eline,
who, of a languid and lymphatic nature, felt the need of tender support, and gentle
warmth of affection, and whose nerves, delicate as the petals of a flower, even in
their soft, velvet-clad surroundings, were often too rudely handled by the slightest
opposition, there developed a kind of timid reserve, which filled her mind with thousands
of small tokens of a secret grief. Then when her measure of half-imaginary sorrows
was full, it would relieve itself in one overwhelming, foaming wave of tearful passion.
In Betsy’s more sanguine nature there grew, nurtured by Eline’s need of support, a
desire for domineering, by means of which she could force her whole psychological
being into that of her pliant sister, to whom, after the first shock, it always brought
a feeling of rest and contentment. But neither Eline’s fear of wounding her fine-strung
temperament, nor Betsy’s over-ruling egoism, could ever have led to a tragic crisis,
as the sharp contrasts of each character became, in the soft enervating atmosphere
of their surroundings, blended and dissolved in one dull tint of neutral gray.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>After one or two dances, where Eline’s little white-satined feet had glided along
in rhythmical accompaniment to a dazzling harmony of brilliant light and colour, soft
strains of melody and dulcet tones of admiration, she received two offers of marriage,
each of which she declined. Those two proposals remained still in her <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>memory as two easily-gained triumphs, but at times the recollection of the first would
call forth a faint sigh from her bosom. It was then that she met Henri van Raat, and
ever since she asked herself how it could possibly be that such a mass of stolidity
as she called him, with so little resemblance to the hero of her dreams, appealed
so strongly to her sympathies, ay, to such an extent that frequently she was overtaken
with a sudden, irresistible impulse to be near him. The heroes of her dreams bore
some resemblance to the idealized image of her father, to the conceptions of Ouida’s
fanciful brain. But they had nothing in common with van Raat, with his sanguine, equable,
complacent temperament, his soft sleepy gray-blue eyes, his laboured speech and heavy
laugh. And yet in his voice, in his glance, there was something that attracted her,
as in his unstudied <i lang="fr">bonhomie</i>. In all this she found support, so that at times she felt conscious of the vague
desire to rest her weary head on his shoulder. And he too felt conscious, with a certain
pride, that he was something to her.
</p>
<p>But this pride vanished, however, the moment that Betsy came between them. Towards
Eline’s sister he felt conscious of such a moral inferiority, that often he was at
a loss to reply to her light and airy banter. At such times, she thought it an exquisite
pleasure, cruel as it was, to draw him out, and tempt him to say things for which
she overwhelmed him with false admiration, only to ridicule them afterwards to his
face, which usually had the effect of reducing his sluggish mind to abject confusion.
Then she would burst out laughing, and the sound of that full hearty laugh, full of
mockery and self-confidence, fired his imagination even more than did the tender feminine
charm of Eline’s presence. Hers was the charm of a weeping soft-eyed siren, raising
her arms in tempting languor from out of the blue of ocean, only to be again drawn
to the depths below with irresistible force; that of Betsy’s, however, was the impetuous
witchery of a gay Bacchante, enchaining his senses with tangled vines, or dashing
her brimming, foaming cup in his face, and intoxicating him with the wild impetuosity
of her joyous nature.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>And so it came about—how he could not really say—but one evening in the dim light
of late autumn, he as with a sudden impulse asked her to be his wife. It had indeed
been a strange evening to him. The one thing he had felt conscious of was that <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>he was as though driven to it, as though hypnotized by an indefinable something in
Betsy’s eyes; he could not but ask her what he eventually did. She, calm and collected,
accepted his offer, taking care to conceal her inward joy at the prospect of having
a home—and more especially a dominion of her own—under an outward appearance of calm
indifference. She longed for a different atmosphere than that of the staid stuffiness
of the big room, with the stately old furniture and dignified surroundings. But when
Eline came and offered him her innocent congratulations, he became suddenly aware
of such an inward surprise and dissatisfaction with himself that he could find no
speech in answer to her sisterly good wishes. And Eline, rudely shaken as she was
by this rapid succession of events, shrunk back in sudden terror of Betsy into her
melancholy reserve, at the same time making every effort—only resulting in the loss
of her own peace of mind—to resist the domineering influence which she had so long
allowed her sister to exercise over her mind.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Betsy and Henk had been married a twelvemonth when aunt died. It was then that, urged
by her, he had looked out for some occupation, for with his eternally calm good-natured
indolence he often bored her much in the same way as a faithful dog, which, ever to
be found at his master’s feet, receives many a kick which a less devoted creature
would have escaped. He too felt in a vague way that a young fellow, be his income
ever so comfortable, ought to do something. However, although he sought, he found
nothing, and in the meantime his ardour had considerably cooled down, now that Betsy
herself did not longer worry him about it.
</p>
<p>And certainly he did not trouble her very much. In the morning he was generally away,
taking what exercise he could on horseback, followed by his two gray boarhounds; in
the afternoon, yielding to his wife’s requests, he accompanied her on sundry calls,
or when relieved of that duty, he visited his club; the evenings being generally spent
by him in accompanying his butterfly wife to concerts and theatres, where he did duty
much after the fashion of <i>Becky Sharp’s</i> faithful sheep-dog, a burdensome but indispensable adjunct. He adapted himself as
well as he could to this much too excited a life; he knew his will was not strong
enough to resist that of Betsy, and he found it suited his temperament much better
quietly to dress and accompany his wife, than to disturb the domestic <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>peace by an intrusion of his own ideas. Then again the few evenings she spent at home
afforded him, with his instinctive love of sociability, a certain sensuous dreamy
happiness, which in the end did more to win his love than when he beheld his wife
beyond his own reach, the most brilliant figure in the grandest ballroom. That only
made him peevish and morose. To her, however, the few evenings she spent at home were
a terrible bore. The singing of the gas-flame made her drowsy, and from her corner
on the sofa she would cast many an angry glance at her husband, as he sat turning
the pages of the illustrated paper or lazily sipping his tea. At such a moment she
would feel an irresistible impulse to urge him on in heaven’s name to look for some
occupation, to which he, astonished at being aroused in such a way from his <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i>, would reply in incoherent heavy sentences.
</p>
<p>She, however, was at heart very happy. For was it not glorious to be able to spend
as much as she chose on her dress? And at the end of the week she would ofttimes remember,
with a smile of happiness, that she had not spent a single evening at home.
</p>
<p>Eline meanwhile had passed the year in melancholy solitude at Aunt Vere’s. She read
much, feeling especially charmed with Ouida’s luxuriant phantasmagory of an idealized
life, sparkling with a wealth of colour, and bathed in the golden sunshine of Italian
skies, vivid and glowing as a glittering kaleidoscope. She would read and literally
devour those pages until, dog-eared and crumpled, they would flutter out of her grasp.
Even at her aunt’s sick-bed, where with a certain feeling of romantic satisfaction
she sat watching night after night, she would read them, again and again.
</p>
<p>In the atmosphere of that sick room, permeated as it was with an ætherealized odour
of drugs, the virtues and prowess of the noble heroes, the spotless beauties of the
arch-wicked or divinely righteous heroines, became endowed with an irresistible charm
of tempting unreality; and Eline often felt a passionate longing to be in one of those
old English mansions, where earls and duchesses were engaged in such exquisite love-making,
and had such romantic meetings under the moon-lit trees of a grand old park. Aunt
died, and Henk and Betsy invited Eline to make their house her home.
</p>
<p>At first she refused, overcome by a strange sadness at the thought of the relationship
of her brother-in-law to her sister. But with an immense exercise of will power she
at length conquered <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>those feelings. Had she not always wondered at the mysterious attraction she felt
for Henk? And now that he was her sister’s husband, there suddenly arose to her mind
such an insurmountable obstacle between them, an obstacle raised by the laws of decency
and custom, that she could, without any risk, give herself over to sisterly sympathy,
and therefore she thought it very childish to allow the memory of the past, and feelings
that she never really had understood, to stand between her and the prospects of a
comfortable home.
</p>
<p>In addition to this, there was the fact that her guardian uncle, Daniel Vere, who
lived in Brussels, and was a bachelor, was too young a man to offer a girl in her
teens a home with him.
</p>
<p>In the end, Eline waived her objections, and with the stipulation that she should
be allowed to contribute a trifle towards her board, took up her abode at her brother-in-law’s.
Henk had at first refused to agree to such a condition, but Betsy remarked that she
could quite understand it; had she been in Eline’s place she too would have done the
same for her own independence’ sake. From the sum settled on her by her parents Eline
derived a yearly income of about £160, and by putting into practice the lessons of
economy she had been taught by her aunt, she managed to dress as elegantly on that,
as did Betsy who always had a well-filled purse at her disposal.
</p>
<p>And thus three years of monotonous existence passed by.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When, the morning after her passionate outburst, Eline came down to breakfast, Henk
had already gone out, bound for the stables, to look after his horses and hounds.
In the breakfast-room there was no one but little Ben, eating, or rather playing with
a slice of bread-and-butter. Betsy she could hear running to and fro with much animation,
and giving her hurried instructions to the cook.
</p>
<p>Frans and Jeanne Ferelyn, and Miss de Woude van Bergh and her brother, were coming
to dinner that day.
</p>
<p>Eline was looking very neat and dressy in a gown of dark gray woollen material, a
gray ribbon round her waist, and a small golden <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>arrow glittering at her throat. She wore neither rings nor bracelets. About her forehead
curled a few fine locks, in frizzy garlands, soft and glossy as frayed silk.
</p>
<p>With a friendly nod she walked round to where the child was seated, and lifting up
his face with both hands pressed a loving kiss on his forehead. Then she sat down,
feeling well at ease with herself, her senses agreeably soothed by the soft warmth
thrown out from the glowing hearth, while outside the snow-flakes were silently wrapping
a down-like mantle around them. With an involuntary smile of satisfaction she rubbed
her slim white hands, and glanced at her rosy, white-tipped finger-nails; then casting
a glance outside, where an old woman, almost bent double, was pushing a barrow of
snow-covered oranges in front of her, she cut open a little breakfast-roll, the while
listening, with amused indifference, to the angry dispute going on between Betsy and
the cook.
</p>
<p>Betsy entered, an ill-humoured expression in her heavily-shaded, twinkling eyes, her
short thick lips compressed with annoyance. She carried a set of cut-glass dessert
trays, which she was about to wash, as the cook had broken one of them. Carefully,
notwithstanding her anger, she placed the trays on the table, and filled a basin with
warm water.
</p>
<p>“That fool of a girl! Fancy washing one of my fine glass dishes in boiling water!
But it serves me right for trusting those idiots to do anything.”
</p>
<p>Her voice sounded harsh and rasping, as she roughly pushed Ben out of the way. Eline,
in unusually good humour, offered her assistance, which was readily accepted by Betsy.
She had a great many things to do yet, she said; but all the same she sat down, watching
Eline carefully washing and drying the dishes one by one, with light graceful movements,
without moistening her fingers or spilling one drop; and she was conscious of the
contrast between her own rough-and-ready way of doing things—the outcome of robust
health—and Eline’s languid grace, mingled as it was with somewhat of fear of tiring
or bespattering herself.
</p>
<p>“By the bye, when I was at the Verstraetens’ yesterday, I heard they were not going
to the opera this evening, as they were tired from last night; aunt asked me if I
would like the box. Do you care to go to the opera?”
</p>
<p>“And what about your visitors?”
</p>
<p>“Jeanne Ferelyn is going early, because her child is unwell, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>I wanted to ask Emilie and her brother to come too. Henk can stay at home. It is a
box for four, you know.”
</p>
<p>“Very well; I don’t mind.”
</p>
<p>Well satisfied with herself, Eline was just putting down the last tray, when all at
once a violent altercation broke out in the kitchen, accompanied by the silvery clattering
of forks and spoons. It was Grete and Mina engaged in rather forcible argument. Betsy
hurried out of the room, and very soon, curt commands and impudent answers followed
each other in rapid succession.
</p>
<p>Ben in the meantime remained standing open-mouthed, and somewhat drowsily, on the
spot where his mother had pushed him, full of silent alarm at all the hubbub.
</p>
<p>“Come, Ben, to auntie’s room,” said Eline, and smilingly she held out her hand towards
him. He came, and both proceeded up-stairs.
</p>
<p>Eline occupied two rooms on the ground floor, a bedroom and a boudoir. With the economy
and good taste which were common to her nature, she had succeeded in imparting to
these rooms a semblance of luxury, with somewhat of an artistic polish. Her piano
occupied an angle in the wall; the heavy foliage of a giant azalea cast a softening
shade over the low, damask-covered couch. In a corner stood a small table laden with
innumerable precious trifles. Statuettes, pictures, feathers, palm branches, filled
every nook. The pink marble mantelpiece was crowned with a miniature Venetian mirror,
suspended by red cords and tassels. In front stood an Amor and Psyche, after Canova,
the group depicting a maiden in the act of removing her veil, and a love-sick, light-winged
god.
</p>
<p>When Eline entered with Ben, the ruddy glow from the hearth shone on her cheeks. She
threw the child a few tattered volumes of engravings, and he settled himself on the
sofa, soon absorbed in the pictures. Eline entered her bedroom, the windows of which
were still covered with daintily-formed leaves and flowers, the effect of the night’s
frost. Yonder stood a toilette duchesse—a vision of tulle and lace—touched up here
and there with the satin bows of old ball bouquets, and laden with scent phials of
Sèvres and fine cut-glass. In the midst of all this wealth of pink and white the mirror
glittered like a sheet of burnished silver. The bedstead was hidden among red draperies,
and in the corner against the door a tall cheval glass reflected a flood of liquid
sunshine.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>For a moment Eline glanced round, to see if her maid had arranged everything to her
satisfaction; then shivering in the chilly atmosphere she returned to her sitting-room
and closed the door. With its semi-Eastern luxury the room was a most pleasant one,
its comfort seemingly enhanced by the cold white glare reflected from the snow outside.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Eline felt as though brimming over with melody—a feeling which could only find adequate
expression in song. She chose the waltz from <i>Mireille</i>. And she sang it with variations of her own, with modulations now swelling into a
full, rich volume of melody, now melting away into the faintest diminuendo, with brilliant
shakes and roulades clear as those of a lark. She no longer thought of the cold and
snow outside. Then suddenly remembering that she had not practised for three days,
she commenced singing scales, brightening her high notes, and trying a difficult portamento.
Her voice resounded with a metallic ring, somewhat cold, but clear and bright as crystal.
</p>
<p>Ben, though well used to these jubilant tones, which reverberated through the whole
house, sat listening in open-mouthed wonder, without bestowing a further glance on
his pictures, now and again giving a sudden start when some exceptionally shrill high
<i>si</i> or <i>do</i> would penetrate his ears.
</p>
<p>Eline was herself at a loss to account for her sadness of yesterday. How and whence
came that fit of melancholy, without any definite cause? what was the overwhelming
joy too that could have so suddenly chased those clouds away?
</p>
<p>To-day she felt animated, happy, joyous; she was sorry that she had not seen the tableaux
yesterday, and she feared that Mr. and Madame Verstraeten did not take her indisposition
<i lang="fr">au sérieux</i>. What a nice, pleasant man he was, Mr. Verstraeten, always full of fun! and Madame
Verstraeten, what a dear good soul! She knew no one like her, so charming and kind.
And then, seated at her piano, now practising a shake, then a chromatic scale, she
allowed her thoughts to wander to other nice people amongst her acquaintances. Yes;
all had their good qualities: the Ferelyns, Emilie de Woude, old Madame van Raat,
Madame van Erlevoort, even Madame van der Stoor. As for Cateau she was a doll.
</p>
<p>And the idea struck her that she would rather like to join that <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>company of players. Yes; they had an admirable conception of the amenities of life.
Frédérique, Marie, Lili, Paul and Etienne, ever gay, ever together, full of droll
plans for their amusement. Indeed, it must be very nice, prettily arrayed in romantic
costumes, to be the objects of general admiration. Paul had a very pretty voice, it
would be splendid to sing duets with him. It quite slipped her memory that only a
few days ago she had assured her singing-master that his voice was absolutely void
of tone. But to-day she was in a pleasant humour, and sang a second waltz, that of
“Juliette” in Gounod’s opera. She adored Gounod.
</p>
<p>It had just struck half-past ten when there was a knock at the door.
</p>
<p>“Come in,” she cried, and looking round she let her slender fingers rest on the keyboard.
Paul van Raat entered.
</p>
<p>“Bon jour, Eline. Hallo, young rascal!”
</p>
<p>“What, Paul, you?” She rose, somewhat surprised to see him. Ben ran towards his uncle
and hoisted himself up on his knees.
</p>
<p>“How early you are! I thought you were coming to sing this afternoon. But you are
welcome all the same; do you hear? Sit down and tell me about the tableaux,” Eline
exclaimed with much animation; then, remembering her illness of the previous day,
she continued in a languid voice—
</p>
<p>“I was awfully sorry I was so ill yesterday. Had a terrible headache.”
</p>
<p>“You don’t look much the worse for it.”
</p>
<p>“It’s true, Paul, really. If I had been well, don’t you think I should have come and
admired your talent? Come, tell me—tell me all about it,” and she drew him with her
to the sofa and threw the pictures on the floor.
</p>
<p>Paul had some difficulty in freeing himself from Ben, who clung to his legs.
</p>
<p>“Come, let go, Ben. And is the headache better now?”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes; quite gone. This afternoon I’ll go round to Mr. Verstraeten to give my congratulations.
But, Paul, do tell me——”
</p>
<p>“I was just about to tell you that I was not coming to sing this afternoon; do you
hear, Elly? I couldn’t bring out a note; I am quite hoarse with the howling and screaming
of yesterday. But we managed splendidly,” and he commenced describing the tableaux.
</p>
<p>It was all his idea, and much of it the work of his own hands; but the girls too had
been hard at it for the last month—getting <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>up the dresses, attending to a thousand trifles. That afternoon Losch was coming to
take a photograph of the last group; so that, even had he been in good voice, he could
not have come to sing. And how stiff in his joints he felt! for he had slaved away
like a navvy, and the girls must be quite exhausted also. No; he had formed no part
in the grouping, he was too busy making all the arrangements. He fell back a little
on the rich damask cushions of the sofa, under the shading branches of the azalea,
and stroked his hair.
</p>
<p>Eline thought how much he resembled Henk, although he was ten years younger, more
slender in figure, livelier, with more delicate features, and an expression of much
greater intelligence. But a simple gesture or movement, a raising of the eyebrows,
would now and again very distinctly illustrate that resemblance, and although his
lips were thinner under his light moustache than Henk’s heavily-bearded upper lip,
his laugh was deep and full as that of his brother.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“Why don’t you take painting lessons of a good master, Paul?” asked Eline. “Surely
if you have talent——”
</p>
<p>“But I have not,” he laughed. “It would not be worth the trouble. I just dabble a
bit in it, just as I do with my singing. It amounts to nothing at all, any of it.”
And he sighed at his Lick of energy to make the most of the little talent he might
possess.
</p>
<p>“You remind me of papa,” she said, and her words assumed a tone of sadness, as the
idealized image of her father rose to her memory. “Yes; he had great talents, but
latterly his health failed him, and he could not produce the great creation of which
his soul was capable. I well remember that he was engaged on an immense canvas, a
scene from Dante’s <i lang="it">Paradiso</i> I believe, when—when he died. Poor papa! But you are young and strong, and I can’t
understand why you don’t do something great, something out of the common.”
</p>
<p>“You know, I suppose, that I am going to be engaged at Hovel’s. Uncle Verstraeten
has arranged it for me.”
</p>
<p>Hovel was a barrister, and as Paul had, at a somewhat early age, and after a period
of alternate studying and idleness, passed the law examination, Uncle Verstraeten
thought he would be doing the young barrister a good turn if he recommended him to
his friend. <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>It had therefore been arranged that Paul should continue working at Hovel’s office,
until he could go in practice for himself.
</p>
<p>“At Hovel’s? A very nice man; I like his wife very much. Oh, that will be splendid,
Paul.”
</p>
<p>“I hope so.”
</p>
<p>“But still, if I were a man I should try and become famous. Come, Ben, don’t be troublesome
now; go and look at the nice pictures on the floor. Wouldn’t you think it splendid
to be famous? Really, if I weren’t Eline Vere I should become an actress.” And she
gave vent to a series of brilliant shakes, which fell from her lips like a sparkling
chain of diamonds.
</p>
<p>“Famous!” and with a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders. “What a silly idea, to be
sure. Famous! No; I don’t want to be famous, not a bit. But for all that I should
like to paint well, or sing well, or something.”
</p>
<p>“Then why don’t you take lessons, either in painting or music? Shall I speak to my
master?”
</p>
<p>“No, thanks; not that old growler of a Roberts, if I can help it. And besides, Eline,
it isn’t really worth while; I should never be able to keep it up whatever it was.
I am subject to sudden fits, you see. Then I think I can do anything, then I am anxious
to hit upon some great subject for a picture——”
</p>
<p>“Like papa,” she interrupted with a sad smile.
</p>
<p>“At other times the fit moves me to make the most of what voice I have; but before
long all those grand ideas have died their own death of sheer inanition, and then
I continue in the same old jog-trot as before.”
</p>
<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself.”
</p>
<p>“Henceforth I shall go and hide the aspirations of my genius in law cases,” he answered
with a laugh, as he rose from his seat. “But now I must be off to the Princesse-gracht,
to the Verstraetens’. So don’t expect me this afternoon; we have several details to
arrange yet before Losch comes. Adieu, Eline; bye-bye, Ben.”
</p>
<p>“Bon jour; I hope you’ll soon get over your hoarseness.”
</p>
<p>Paul went, and Eline once more sat down at the piano. For a while she sat thinking
what a pity it was Paul had so little energy, and from him her thoughts reverted again
to Henk. But she felt altogether too light-hearted this morning to do much philosophizing,
and, full of exuberant spirits demanding an outlet, she continued <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>her singing, until the mid-day gong summoned her and Ben down-stairs.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Paul had told his mother that he would not be home that afternoon for coffee, as he
would be at the Verstraetens’. He lodged at Madame van Raat’s, in the Laan van Meerdervoort.
Madame van Raat, an elder sister of Madame Verstraeten, was a stately dame, with pensive,
light-blue eyes, and hair of silver gray, dressed in old-fashioned style, whilst over
her whole being there was suffused, as it were, a calmness, a placid resignation,
that unmistakably spoke of former days free from troubles and disappointments. As
walking exercise was becoming irksome to her, she was mostly to be found seated in
her high-backed arm-chair, the dull-gray head drooping on her bosom, the blue-veined
hands folded in her lap. Thus she continued to lead a quiet, monotonous existence,
the aftermath of a placid, all but cloudless life, by the side of her husband, on
whose portrait she frequently allowed her eyes to dwell, as it hung before her yonder,
in its smart general’s uniform; a good-looking, frank, manly face, with a pair of
truthful, intelligent eyes, and an engaging expression about the firm, closed mouth.
To her, life had brought but few great sorrows, and for that, in the simplicity of
her faith, she felt piously grateful. But now, now she was tired, oh! so tired, her
spirit quite broken by the death of that husband to whom, to the last, she had clung
with an affection constant and calm as the bosom of a limpid stream, into the placid
waters of which the impetuous waves of her youthful love had flowed away. After his
death, she began to worry over every trifling circumstance, petty vexations with servants
and tradespeople. All these she connected, until to her mind they formed an unbroken
chain of irksome burdens. Yes, she felt she was growing old; time had little more
to give her, and so, in silent egoism, she mused her life away in the long-vanished
poesy of the past. She had had three children: her youngest, a girl, was dead.
</p>
<p>Of her two sons, her favourite was Henk, who, strong and big, reminded her the most
of his father, whilst in her eyes his sleepy good-nature had more of open, frank manliness,
than Paul’s finer-strung fickleness and airy geniality. Paul she had always found
too unsettled and nervous: formerly, in his constantly interrupted studies at Leyden—at
last, thanks to a little moral pressure on the part of Uncle Verstraeten, crowned
with promotion—as well as <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>now with his staying out late at night, his rage for painting, <i lang="fr">tableaux-vivants</i> and duets, or his fits of indolence, when he would lounge away a whole afternoon
on the sofa, over a book he did not read.
</p>
<p>Before his marriage, Henk, being of a more staid and homely character than Paul, felt
himself better at ease in his mother’s house; although he was quiet, his silence never
irritated her; it was like the silence of a faithful dog, watching with half-closed
eyes over his mistress. She felt so at her ease with Henk. She disliked being alone,
for it was in solitude that the memories of the past contrasted in their rosy brightness
too sharply with the leaden-gray that was the prevailing hue of her present life,
and Paul she saw but rarely, except when hastily swallowing his dinner, in order to
keep an appointment. She seldom went out, unaccustomed as she had grown to the noisy
traffic of the streets, and the hum of many voices.
</p>
<p>Henk was her pet, and with her mental vision unimpaired, wherever at least her son
was concerned, she regretted his marriage with Betsy Vere. No; she was not a fit wife
for her child, and knowing that, she could not bring herself to give him her hearty
approval or her parental blessing, when he told her of his engagement. Still, she
refrained from opposing her beloved son in his choice, fearing lest she should be
the cause of unhappiness; it was therefore under a false assumption of frankness,
at which she was surprised herself, that she had concealed her ill-feeling against
the intruder, and welcomed her as her daughter. All the same, she felt deeply concerned
about Henk. Madame Vere she had known slightly; passionate and domineering, she never
found anything attractive in such a personality, and this daughter reminded her too
much of that mother. Although, in her eyes, Henk was possessed of much more firmness
of character than Vere, of whom she could not think but as a pallid, ailing sufferer,
only too glad to allow his wife to think and act for him; although Henk, as she thought,
had all the frank manliness of character of his father, and would not allow himself
to be domineered over; still, happy as she had been with van Raat, it would never
be <i>his</i> lot to be. And at that thought she would sigh and her eyes would grow moist; her
mother’s love, despite her blindness to his failings, was the instinct which gave
her an inkling of the truth, and if she could have taken his place, she would gladly
have given up her own former happiness to her son, and have suffered for him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>Her thoughts ran away with her as she saw Leentje, the servant, laying the cloth for
lunch for herself alone, and with a weary resignation at the hateful loneliness of
her days, she sat down. To-morrow would be to her as to-day; what remained of her
life was but an aftermath of summer, and though autumn and winter might be free from
storms, yet the only promise they held out was that of a barren, soulless lethargy.
To what end did she live?
</p>
<p>And so weary did she feel under the leaden pressure of this soul-killing loneliness,
that she could not even muster up the energy to scold Leentje for her clumsiness,
although she could not help noticing the damage that was done to one of her old china
dishes.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Much earlier than she was wont to go out, Eline went to the Verstraetens’ that afternoon.
It was near the end of November, and winter had already set in with extreme severity.
There was a sharp frost; the snow, still white and unsullied, crackled under Eline’s
light, regular tread, but her feet preferred to feel the smoothness of the clean-swept
pavement; the delicately-gloved hands were hidden away in the small muff. At times
bestowing a friendly nod, from under her veil, on some passing acquaintance, she proceeded
along the Java-straat to the Princesse-gracht. She still felt in a happy humour, which
was quite undisturbed by the little tiff she had had with Betsy about some trifling
question with the servants. These little bickerings were not of such rare occurrence
lately, although they always irritated Henk beyond measure.
</p>
<p>But Eline had not taken much notice of Betsy’s words, and had replied to her with
less sharpness than was her wont; she did not care to allow such trifles to spoil
her good-humour: life was too dear to her——
</p>
<p>And feeling glad that she had curbed her temper, she turned the corner of the Java-straat.
</p>
<p>At the Verstraetens’ there still prevailed an unusual disorder. Dien was loth to admit
her, but Eline took no notice, and passed inside to the large reception-room, where
she found Madame Verstraeten, who apologized for being in her dressing-gown. Losch,
the photographer, half hidden under the green cloth of his apparatus, was taking a
view of the group representing the Five Senses. The girls, Etienne, and Paul smiled
their welcome to Eline, who said it was splendid still to be able to see something
of the tableaux. But now, in the chill snow-reflected daylight, the scene no longer
<span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>created the vivid, glowing impression of the previous evening, nor had it the same
wealth of colouring, with which a plentiful application of Bengal fire had endowed
it. The draperies hung in loose and crumpled folds; Frédérique’s cloth of gold had
a smudged, faded tint, her ermine had more the appearance of white and black wool.
Etienne’s fair wig was decidedly out of curl. Lili, representing the sense of Smelling,
lay half dozing in her pillows.
</p>
<p>“I am afraid it won’t come to much,” said Marie, as Losch was arranging her draperies;
but Toosje van der Stoor thought otherwise and remained lying motionless, with a terribly
cramped feeling, owing to her difficult attitude.
</p>
<p>Eline, unwilling to disturb the artistes in their grouping, sat down beside Mr. Verstraeten.
He laid away his book and removed his eye-glasses, and with his sparkling brown eyes
glanced with unfeigned pleasure at the graceful girl.
</p>
<p>“Do you know,” she said, as she unhooked the little fur-lined cloak, “do you know,
I am really jealous of that little group there. They are always together, always happy
and jolly, and full of fun and amusing ideas—really I feel quite old by the side of
them.”
</p>
<p>“Just fancy that!” answered Madame Verstraeten, laughing. “You are of the same age
as Marie, three-and-twenty, aren’t you?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; but I was never spoilt as Marie and Lili are being now, and yet I think I should
not have minded a bit. You know, of course, when I was a child—papa was mostly ill,
and naturally that threw a damper over us; and afterwards at Aunt Vere’s house—aunt
was a dear, good woman, but much elder than papa, and not very jolly certainly——”
</p>
<p>“You must not say anything about Aunt Vere, Eline!” said Mr. Verstraeten; “she was
an old flame of mine——”
</p>
<p>“And <i>you</i> must not laugh at her; I was very fond of her; she really was a second mother to
us, and when that long illness ended in her death, I felt the loss keenly, I was as
alone in the world. You see, all these things were not exactly calculated to make
my youth a very gay one.” And she smiled a saddened smile, whilst at the thought of
all she had been deprived of, her eyes glistened with moisture. “But when you look
at Paul and Etienne, and the girls, it’s nothing but laughter and pleasure—really,
enough to make me jealous. And that Toos, too, she is a dear child.”
</p>
<p>The artistes came down from the platform. Losch had finished. <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>Paul and Etienne, with Freddy, Marie, and Cateau came forward, whilst Lili went to
bed, thoroughly exhausted with the excitement of the last two days.
</p>
<p>“Good morning, Miss Vere,” said Cateau, as she held out her little hand to Eline.
</p>
<p>Eline felt a sudden, indescribable, unreasoning sympathy for that child, so simple
and so unconsciously engaging, and as she rose to go, she was obliged to hide her
emotion by playfully embracing the child.
</p>
<p>“Good-bye, darling,” she said dotingly. “I am going, Madame Verstraeten; there is
still plenty left for you to do, now that all that excitement is over. Ah! yes—I promised
Betsy to ask you for the tickets. May I have them?”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>It was still early, only half-past two, and Eline thought what a long time it was
since she had visited old Madame van Raat, and she knew that the old lady liked her,
and was always glad to have a chat in the afternoon. Henk never failed to visit his
mother every morning after his ride, and the two boarhounds, whom his wife had banished
from his home, followed him undisturbed up the stairs in his mother’s house. As for
Betsy, of her the old lady saw very little; Betsy was well enough aware that Madame
van Raat did not care for her. Eline, however, had succeeded in winning her affections,
by means of a certain most engaging manner she had when in the company of aged ladies;
in the tone of her voice, in her little attentions, there was a something, a delicate
flavour of respect, which charmed the old dame.
</p>
<p>Eline returned through the Java-straat to the Laan van Meerdervoort, and found Madame
van Raat alone, seated in her high-backed chair, her hands folded in her lap. And
in the young girl’s eyes she appeared such a picture of mute sadness; over the rich
faded furniture there hovered such a melancholy shadow of past comfort; the whole
apartment was filled with such an atmosphere of sorrow, and about the folds of the
dark green curtains there hung such a mist of melancholy, that on entering, Eline
felt her heart grow cold within her, as though a voice had told her that life was
not worth living.
</p>
<p>But she struggled against the feeling. She recalled those thoughts which in the morning
had brought her such lightness of heart. She smiled, and her tone assumed that vague
respect, mingled with <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>somewhat of love and pity, and with much animation she spoke about Paul, about the
tableaux, about that evening’s dinner, and the opera—and promised Madame van Raat
to send her some books, nice light literature, in which one looked at the world through
rose-coloured glasses.
</p>
<p>It pained her to chatter in this way; she would much rather have sat and cried with
the old dame, in sympathetic melancholy, but she controlled herself, and even plucked
up courage to touch upon a more serious subject. With her engaging, respectful manner,
she took Madame to task for having been discovered by her with moistened eyes, which
now she would not own; she was not inquisitive, but she would so gladly console and
cheer her, if she could; and why did she not again make her her confidante, as she
had done before, and so on.
</p>
<p>And the old lady, already placed at her ease by this charm of manner, smilingly shook
her head; really, there was nothing the matter at all; she only felt a little lonely.
Ah, it was her own fault, she feared, for there was very little in which she still
took any interest. Other old people read the papers and continued to take an interest
in things generally; but not she. Yes, it was all her own fault; but Eline <i>was</i> a dear girl; why could not Betsy be a little like her?
</p>
<p>And with increased animation, she began to talk about her dear husband; over there
was his portrait.…
</p>
<p>It was past four when Eline hurried away; it was growing dark, it was thawing, and
the lowering clouds threatened to fall upon her and choke her. That old lady had been
happy, very happy.… and she, Eline, was not happy, even at her age—oh! how would she
feel when she too would be old, ugly, and shrivelled up! To her even the memories
of the past would bring no comfort, nor yet the solacing thought that happiness did
exist, that she had tasted its sweets; to her all would be dull and leaden as the
clouds above! “Oh, God, why live, if life were void of happiness?—why, why?” she whispered,
and she hurried on to dress for dinner.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>It was to be a simple, homely little dinner. At half-past six the Ferelyns came, and
shortly after, Emilie and Georges. Betsy received them in the drawing-room, and asked
Jeanne how the child was.
</p>
<p>“She is much easier now, the little dot; the fever is gone, but still <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>she is not quite better. Doctor Reyer said she was getting on. It’s very nice of you
to have invited us; a little change is really necessary for me. But you see, I took
your word for it that it would be quite a family party, so I haven’t dressed for it.”
And with some misgiving her eyes wandered from her own plain black dress to Betsy’s
gown of gray satin.
</p>
<p>“Really, there is no one else coming but Emilie here, and her brother. But you told
me you would be going home early, so we have arranged, later on, to look in at the
opera, in Uncle Verstraeten’s box. So you need not be uneasy, you were quite right
to come as you are.”
</p>
<p>Henk, looking jolly and contented, entered in his smoking-jacket, and on seeing him
Jeanne felt more reassured than by all Betsy’s protestations. With Emilie, lively
as ever, she was on the most intimate terms, and it was Georges alone, with his immaculate
shirt-front, and his big gardenia, who made her feel somewhat uneasy at her own simple
dress.
</p>
<p>Frans Ferelyn, an East-Indian official, was in Holland on furlough, and his wife was
an old school-mate of Eline’s and Betsy’s.
</p>
<p>Jeanne seemed a homely little woman, very quiet and depressed under her domestic troubles.
Delicate, emaciated, and pallid, with a pair of soft brown eyes, she felt crushed
under the double burden of pecuniary embarrassment and anxiety for her three ailing
children, and she felt an irresistible longing for India, the land of her birth, and
for the quiet life she led there. She suffered much from the cold, and numbered the
months she would still have to pass in Holland. She told Emilie of her life at Temanggoeng
in the Kadoe—Frans was Comptroller first-class—in the midst of a menagerie of Cochin-China
fowls, ducks, pigeons, a cow, two goats, and a cockatoo. “Just like Adam and Eve in
Paradise,” remarked Emilie. Then she told them how each morning she used to look after
her Persian roses and her pretty azaleas, and gather her vegetables from her own garden,
and how her children, immediately on their arrival in Holland, were taken ill and
began to cough. “’Tis true, in India they looked rather pale, but there at least they
were not obliged to be in constant fear of draughts and open doors.” And she was sorry
that, owing to the expense of the voyage, she had had to come away without her baboo,
Saripa. She was now in service at Samarang, but she <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>had promised to come back to her “as soon as we are home again,” and she was to bring
her over some pretty frocks from Holland.
</p>
<p>Emilie listened attentively, and did her best to set her talking; she knew how those
Indian reminiscences could draw Jeanne out of her usual quiet reserve. Betsy considered
her out of place in company, so when she did ask her, it was always together with
her husband, and if possible, with one or two others. The fact was, she thought her
a bore, generally ill-dressed, and her conversation flat and uninteresting, but still
she could not help occasionally inviting her, more with a kind of pity than anything
else.
</p>
<p>While Frans Ferelyn was speaking to Henk about his forthcoming promotion to Assistant
Resident, and Georges was listening to Jeanne telling him about Frans’s horse one
day stepping right into their room to fetch his <i>pisang</i>, Betsy lay back in her chair, thinking how long Eline was. She would have liked to
have dined early, so as not to be so very late at the opera, and she inwardly hoped
that the Ferelyns would not be indiscreet and stay too long. Amusing they certainly
were not, she thought, and she rose, concealing her impatience, to fix a bunch of
peacock feathers in one of the vases, a few of the knick-knacks on the little centre
table; then with her foot she arranged the tiger-skin rug in front of the flaming
hearth, all the time feeling annoyed at Eline’s delay.
</p>
<p>At length the door opened and Eline entered, and Jeanne could not help noticing how
pretty and elegant she looked in her pink rep silk frock, simple but rich, with a
neat little bow here and there on her V-shaped corsage, on the short sleeves, and
at the waist. In her light-brown, back-combed hair she wore a <i>touffe</i> of wavy pink feathers with a small aigrette; her nimble feet were encased in small
pink shoes; a single string of pearls encircled her throat. In her hands she held
her long gloves, her fan of pink ostrich feathers, and her <i>binocle</i> set in mother-of-pearl.
</p>
<p>Ferelyn and de Woude rose, and she shook hands with them, and kissed Emilie and Jeanne,
at the same time inquiring about little Dora. She noticed how all, even Henk and Betsy,
took stock of her, from head to foot, struck as they were with the rich simplicity
of her dress: and when Jeanne spoke to her about her child, she smiled upon the struggling
little woman, all conscious of the effect of her brilliant charms.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>At table, Eline chatted pleasantly with de Woude, next to whom <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>she was seated. Betsy sat between her two gentlemen guests, Emilie between Henk and
Frans, Jeanne between Eline and Henk. In the somewhat sombre dining-room, with its
antique furniture, the table glistened with snowy damask, with silver and fine glass,
whilst the rays of gas-light glinted on decanters and glasses, making the dark-red
or amber-coloured wine appear to quiver under the glow of its radiance. From amid
a nest of flowers in a silver basket rose the prickly crown of a splendid pine.
</p>
<p>De Woude commenced telling Eline about the soirée at the Verstraetens’, and in glowing
terms described how well Miss van Erlevoort had looked her parts, successively as
Cleopatra and the sense of Sight. With Emilie, Frans, and Betsy the conversation turned
on India. In this Jeanne joined every now and again, but she sat too far away, and
her attention was diverted by de Woude’s chattering and the little shrill laugh of
Eline, who was engaged in a mild flirtation.
</p>
<p>Henk drank his soup and ate his fish in silence, occasionally addressing a short monosyllable
to Jeanne or Emilie. And Jeanne grew more and more silent, as much from feeling ill
at ease, as from fatigue at her long talk to Emilie after a day full of worries. She
felt very much out of place, next to that coquettish couple. Eline in full toilet,
de Woude in his evening dress, to which her own little black dress offered a shabby
contrast. Still, she was glad she sat next to Henk, and in her own <i>malaise</i> she was conscious of a vague sort of sympathy for him, who was as much out of place
there as herself.
</p>
<p>And she could not help comparing herself with Eline and Betsy: she, struggling with
her three children and her husband’s slender furlough allowance; Eline and Betsy,
on the other hand, unhampered, and ever moving in a whirl of pleasures and excitement.
Where was the old, happy friendship that united them in one bond, when all three used
to go hand-in-hand to school, Eline with the cape of her mackintosh filled with cherries,
and she herself under Betsy’s leadership giving free vent to her childish spirits
in naughty answers to the governess? She felt herself repelled by that young wife,
with her self-conscious, indifferent manner, and her domineering tone towards her
husband; repelled also by that young girl, who appeared to her frivolous and vain
in her conversation, full of brilliant nothings; and by that dandy. Eline, especially,
she could not understand; in her she found something uncommon, something <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>indefinable and puzzling, and certain attributes which seemed ever at war with one
another. Her laughter about nothing at all wearied her, and she wondered how it was
that a girl who, as they said, sang so divinely, could have such an unpleasant and
affected laugh. Oh! if they would but be silent for a moment!.… And in her heart she
longed to be back once more in her humble apartments, with her little Dora. Why had
she accepted that invitation? ’Tis true Frans had insisted, now that the child was
out of danger, that she should have some change and relaxation, but this dinner-party
gave her no relaxation; on the contrary, it made her nervous and confused, and she
declined Henk’s offer of sweetbreads and asparagus which he recommended her.
</p>
<p>“Did I hear aright, Miss Emilie; is Mr. de Woude a brother of yours?” Frans asked
softly. It was the first time that he had met either Emilie or Georges, and he was
as much struck by their resemblance as by the contrast between them.
</p>
<p>“Certainly,” whispered Emilie; “and I am proud of him too. He is an awful swell, but
a nice boy; he is engaged at the Foreign Office. Be careful, don’t you think bad of
him!” she laughed, and held up her finger threateningly, as though she read Ferelyn’s
thoughts.
</p>
<p>“I have scarcely exchanged more than half a dozen words with Mr. de Woude as yet,
so I should be sorry to express any opinion about him so soon,” he said, a little
alarmed at Emilie’s brusqueness.
</p>
<p>“That’s right; most people get a very different opinion of Georges after they have
known him some time, from that formed when they first met him. You see, like a loving
sister, I take my brother’s part. Just fill my glass, please.”
</p>
<p>“Yes; you champion him even before he is attacked!” resumed Ferelyn smiling, as he
filled her glass; “but thus much I can see already, that he is a spoilt pet of the
ladies, not only of his sisters, but also of Madame van Raat and Miss Vere.”
</p>
<p>Betsy joined in the conversation with Eline and Georges, feeling attracted by the
latter’s lively manner, as he chatted away, skimming over all sorts of subjects; a
conversation without substance, without actual wit, but light as foam, airy as soap-bubbles,
sparkling as firework crackers. In such a conversation she was in her element; serious
talk, be it ever so spirited, was too burdensome for her; but this tintinnabulation
of sparks and foam-flecks, <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>like wine glistening through crystal beakers, charmed her exceedingly. She thought
Georges much more amusing than he was yesterday at the Verstraetens’, where he had
twice observed that the effect of red light was more flattering than that of green.
To-day he did not repeat himself, but rattled on, interrupting her with laughing impudence,
and rounding off his sentences with truly French vivacity.
</p>
<p>Several times Eline tried to lead Jeanne into that circle of sparkling nothings, but
in return Jeanne had only smiled a faint smile, or just answered with a single monosyllable,
and at length Eline gave up the attempt to draw her out. The conversation grew more
general; Emilie joined in with her easy nonchalance and airy banter; and Frans, in
the midst of this charmed circle, could not help throwing in a stray spark of fun,
although his eyes frequently rested with an anxious look on his quiet little wife.
</p>
<p>To Jeanne it seemed as though the dinner would never come to an end. Although she
had not the slightest appetite, she did not like to continue refusing, so she took
of the truffled chicken, of the <i lang="fr">gâteau Henri IV.</i>, of the pines, and the choice dessert; her wine, however, she merely touched with
her lips. Henk, next her, ate much, and with evident gusto, wondering why she helped
herself to such small portions. De Woude ate but little, his continued talking prevented
that; but Emilie did her share, and was not sparing with the wine.
</p>
<p>It was past eight when they rose, and the ladies retired to the drawing-room. Frans
joined Henk and de Woude in a cigar, as Jeanne had expressed her desire to stay another
half-hour. Betsy had asked her to do so; she could not let her guests go so soon,
and there would be plenty of time for the opera.
</p>
<p>“Is Dora often ill, Jeanne?” asked Eline, as with a rustle of her red silk she sat
down on the sofa beside her, and took her hand. “Last time I saw her nothing ailed
her, and even then I thought she was looking very pale and delicate.”
</p>
<p>Jeanne gently withdrew her hand, and felt something like irritation at such a question
after the conversation at table. She made but curt reply. But Eline persisted, as
though she intended by her present amiability to make good her former neglect; and
she managed to impart such a sympathetic tone to her voice, that Jeanne felt quite
touched. Jeanne began to express her fears that Doctor Reyer had not examined her
little girl as carefully as he <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>might; and Eline, whilst sipping her coffee, listened with evident interest to her
maternal plaints. Emilie and Betsy had meanwhile gone into the adjoining boudoir,
to look at some fashion-plates.
</p>
<p>“Poor girl! what a lot of cares and worries you have, and scarcely three months in
Holland yet! You only arrived in September, did you not?” asked Eline, as she placed
the little china cup on the round table in front of her.
</p>
<p>Jeanne was silent; but all at once she rose up, and in her turn grasping Eline’s slender
fingers, she remarked, in her longing for affection—
</p>
<p>“Eline, you know I have always been pretty straightforward and frank; may I ask you
something?”
</p>
<p>“Of course you may,” answered Eline, rather surprised.
</p>
<p>“Well, then—why we are no longer to each other what we were formerly, when your parents
were still living? It is now four years since I married and went to India, and now
that we have returned, now when I see you again, all seems so different between yourself
and me. I have no acquaintances, and but few relations in the Hague, and I should
so much like to keep my old friends to myself.”
</p>
<p>“But, Jeanne——”
</p>
<p>“Yes; I know you think it foolish of me to talk like that; but at times I feel so
terribly depressed with all that flummery and false excitement, I do so long to unburden
myself to some dear true friend—for of course I cannot say all I wish to my husband.”
</p>
<p>“Why not?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, he has enough of his own worries; he is ill, and—peevish.”
</p>
<p>“But, Jeanne, I really don’t see what change has come between us.”
</p>
<p>“Perhaps it is only my fancy after all. You see, formerly we used to be oftener together,
now you move in such a different circle. You go out a good deal, and I—well, you see,
we have become much estranged from one another.”
</p>
<p>“But considering that we have not seen each other for four years——”
</p>
<p>“But we kept up the correspondence.”
</p>
<p>“What value is there in three or four letters in the course of a year? Doesn’t it
seem natural that one’s ideas change, as one gets older, and is placed in different
circumstances? <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>Yes; I have had my cares and worries too. First it was dear papa, then Aunt Vere,
whom I attended in her illness——”
</p>
<p>“Are you happy here? can you get along with Betsy?”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes, admirably, or I should not stay with her, of course.” Eline, with her usual
reserve, deemed it unnecessary to say more about it.
</p>
<p>“You see, there is no need for you to trouble yourself about anything,” Jeanne continued;
“things come about just as you wish them; you are free and unfettered, and live only
for your pleasures—it is all so different with me.”
</p>
<p>“But surely all that does not justify you in saying that we have become estranged
from each other. In the first place, I think ‘estranged’ is a most unpleasant word,
and secondly, it is not true, whatever word you may use.”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes.”
</p>
<p>“Oh no. I assure you, Jeanne dear, if I can be of service to you in any way, you will
find me quite at your disposal. Do you believe me?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, I do, and I thank you very much. But, Eline——”
</p>
<p>“Well?”
</p>
<p>Several questions rose to Jeanne’s lips. She felt eager to ask her to tell her more
about herself, to be more free and open with her; but the studied cordiality of the
smile that hovered about the delicate lips, and was reflected in those dreamy, almond
eyes, effectually silenced her. And she felt a sudden regret at her frankness towards
such a coquette of a girl deftly playing with her fan; it was mere waste of time in
talking to her. Why had she allowed herself to yield to the first impulse? for they
were entirely unsuited to one another.…
</p>
<p>“Well?” Eline repeated, at the same time fearing what the next question might be.
</p>
<p>“Another time, when we are alone again!” stammered Jeanne, and she rose, dissatisfied,
annoyed with herself, feeling ready to burst into tears, after that unsociable dinner
and fruitless conversation. Betsy and Emilie were just leaving the boudoir.
</p>
<p>Jeanne thought it was time to be going. The three gentlemen came in, and Henk assisted
her with her cloak. With a forced cordiality she took her leave, thanking Betsy for
her invitation, and again she shivered with annoyance when Eline kissed her cheeks.
</p>
<p>“What an awful bore she is, that Jeanne!” said Betsy, after the <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>Ferelyns had gone. “She scarcely opened her mouth. What were you talking about together,
Eline?”
</p>
<p>“Oh—about Dora, and her husband, nothing else.”
</p>
<p>“Poor girl!” said Emilie pityingly. “Come, Georges, just fetch my cloak.”
</p>
<p>Mina, however, was just coming in with the ladies’ wraps, and de Woude put on his
ulster, whilst Henk rubbed his big hands, well pleased at the prospect of spending
the evening at home after a nice dinner. The carriage had already been waiting outside
in the thawing snow for the last half-hour, with Dirk the coachman and Herman the
footman seated on the box, half smothered in their big fur capes.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“Oh, Frans, never ask me to accept another invitation of the van Raats!” said Jeanne,
in an imploring voice, as, on her husband’s arm, she shiveringly went splashing along
the muddy streets, while, with her little hands benumbed with cold, she constantly
endeavoured to keep her cloak fastened, each time that a gust of wind blew the ends
open. “Really I don’t feel at home any more with them, with Betsy and Eline.”
</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders and said nothing. They plodded on with their mud-bespattered
shoes, in the flickering light of the street lanterns, whose dull rays were reflected
with monotonous regularity in the numerous puddles they had to pass.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The third act of <i lang="fr">Le Tribut de Zamora</i> had just commenced, when Betsy, Emilie, Eline, and Georges entered their box. There
was a full house, and their arrival broke in upon the silence that prevailed in the
listening auditorium; there was a rustling of silk and satin; a hundred eyes and opera-glasses
were directed to their box, and here and there the question was whispered, “Who are
they?”
</p>
<p>Emilie and Eline sat down in front, Betsy and Georges behind them, while Eline laid
down her fan and her pearl-rimmed <i>binocle</i>. Then she slowly commenced to untie her white plush, red satin-lined cloak, and as
a cloud of pink and white it glided from her shoulders, and de Woude folded it over
the back of her fauteuil. And in the triumph of her beauty it did her good to see
how she was stared at and admired.
</p>
<p>“What a number of people there are here this evening! we are <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>fortunate,” whispered Emilie. “There’s nothing, I think, so wretched as to see an
empty house.”
</p>
<p>“You are right!” said Betsy. “Look, there are the Eekhofs, Ange and Léonie, with their
mamma. They were at the Verstraetens’ too yesterday; next week they are giving a <i lang="fr">soirée dansante</i>.” And she nodded to the girls.
</p>
<p>“The new baritone from Brussels, Théo Fabrice, sings this evening,” said de Woude
to Eline. “You know that since the débuts commenced, two have been dismissed; he makes
the third.”
</p>
<p>“How terribly long those débuts are this winter!” remarked Eline, in an indifferent
tone.
</p>
<p>“The tenor robusto was all right from the first, but they say Fabrice is very good
too. Look, there he comes.”
</p>
<p>The chorus of Ben-Saïd’s odalisques was ended, and the Moorish sovereign entered his
palace, leading Xaïma by the hand. But Eline paid little attention; she glanced round
the theatre, and gave a friendly nod of recognition as her eyes met those of some
acquaintance, and she did not cast another glance in the direction of the stage until
Ben-Saïd and his slave were seated under the canopy, and the ballet commenced. That
attracted her, and her eyes followed the <i lang="fr">danseuses</i>, as, gliding along on the tips of their toes, they ranged themselves in groups beneath
the Moorish arches, and under the uplifted veils and fans of silver fringe, their
forms encased in corsages of glossy satin, and all a-glitter with the spangles on
their gauze-like frocks.
</p>
<p>“A pretty ballet!” said Emilie, yawning behind her fan, and she leaned back cosily
in her fauteuil, somewhat under the generous influence of her choice dinner.
</p>
<p>Eline nodded her head, and while at the back of her she could hear Betsy and Georges
whispering together, she still followed the clever gyrations of the <i lang="fr">première danseuse</i>, as with graceful movements she hovered beneath the waving fans of the dancers on
the tips of her pointed, satin-clad feet, a dazzling aigrette of diamonds in her hair.
</p>
<p>With her dreamy, idealistic nature, Eline was passionately fond of the opera, not
only because it afforded her the opportunity of being the object of general admiration,
not only because of the music, or that she was anxious to hear one or another aria
sung by some celebrated <i lang="it">prima donna</i>, but also because of the intricate, romantic-coloured plot, the somewhat rudely-painted
melodramatic <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>effects, full of hatred and love and revenge, the conventionality of which did not
trouble her, and in which she did not even look for any truth. There was no need for
her to forget for one moment that they were but actors and actresses whom she saw
before her, and not knights and noble ladies; that she was seated in a crowded, brilliantly
illumined theatre, looking at painted scenes, and listening to the harmony of a visible
orchestra, and not living with hero and heroine through some more or less poetic period
of the middle ages; but none the less did she enjoy herself, if the actors did not
sing too badly, nor play with too much prosy conventionality.
</p>
<p>Betsy, on the other hand, went to the opera with the object only of seeing and being
seen; Eline’s intense enjoyment she would have voted childish in the extreme, but
Eline enjoyed in secret, for she suspected Betsy’s opinion, and so left her sister
in the belief that she, like herself, found no pleasure in the theatre but to see
and to be seen by friends and acquaintances.
</p>
<p>The ballet was at an end. Ben-Saïd and Xaïma descended from their throne, and he sang
the recitative—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Je m’efforce en vain de te plaire!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and then the air:
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O Xaïma, daigne m’entendre!
</p>
<p class="line">Mon âme est à toi sans retour!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The new baritone’s voice was full and sonorous, more like that of a basso cantante,
and in his song he enveloped it as with a veil of melancholy.
</p>
<p>But in his rich Moorish dress he had a heavy appearance; and neither in his attitude
nor in his acting did he succeed in imparting even the merest semblance of amorous
homage, and he looked at the <i lang="it">prima donna</i>, in her dress of cloth of silver, and her long pearl-clad fair hair, with more of
threatening rage in his glance than with the humility of a tender devotion.
</p>
<p>Eline was not insensible to the shortcomings in his acting; but still, the very contrast
between the expression of haughty superiority in his demeanour and the tone of humility
in his voice pleased her. She followed every note of the song, and when at the sudden
fortissimo of Ben-Saïd’s metallic organ, the actress appeared to tremble with terror,
Eline asked herself the question—
</p>
<p>“Why is she so frightened, I wonder?—what is the matter? He does not look so bad.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>And during the applause that followed the song she glanced round the theatre, when
by accident her eye fell upon a group of gentlemen standing just at the entrance to
the stalls. She noticed how they stared at her box, and with her graceful languor
she was about to draw back a little, when she saw one of them look at her with a smile
of recognition. For a moment she looked at him with wide-opened eyes, and in her surprise
did not return the salutation, but with a quick movement she turned round, laid her
hand on Betsy’s shoulder, and whispered in her ear—
</p>
<p>“Just look, Betsy; do you see who is standing there?”
</p>
<p>“Where? who?”
</p>
<p>“There, in the stalls—Vincent—don’t you see?”
</p>
<p>“Vincent!” Betsy repeated, amazed in her turn. “So it is, Vincent!”
</p>
<p>They both nodded to Vincent, who laughingly fixed them with his glass, upon which
Eline hid her face coquettishly behind her fan.
</p>
<p>“Who is it? who is Vincent?” asked Emilie and Georges.
</p>
<p>“Vincent Vere, a first cousin,” Betsy answered. “Oh, such a silly boy; nobody ever
knows where he is; sometimes you don’t see him for months at a time, then all at once
he stands before you again. I had no idea at all that he was at the Hague. Eline,
for gracious sake, don’t fidget so with that fan.”
</p>
<p>“I don’t want him to stare at me,” said Eline; and with a graceful turn of her shapely
arm she held her fan before her face.
</p>
<p>“When did you see your cousin last, Madame van Raat?” asked Georges.
</p>
<p>“Oh, more than eighteen months ago. I think he was going to London, where he was to
be a reporter on a paper, or something of that sort. Fancy, they say he was in the
Foreign Legion in Algeria for some time, but I don’t believe it. He has been everywhere,
and he never has a <i lang="fr">sou</i>.”
</p>
<p>“Yes; now I remember, I have seen him before,” said Emilie, with a yawn. “A curious
customer.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, that he is. But you see here, at the Hague, where he has relations, he knows
he must be on his best behaviour, so we tolerate his presence.”
</p>
<p>“Yes,” remarked Emilie, very philosophically, “you generally find a black sheep like
that in every family.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span></p>
<p>Eline smiled, and slowly closed her fan.
</p>
<p>The third act came to an end without her understanding much about the scena with <span class="corr" id="xd31e952" title="Source: Manöel">Manoël</span>, but the grand duo between Hermosa and Xaïma afforded her a clue: it was the mutual
recognition of mother and daughter after the air—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Debout, enfants d’Ibérie!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and the curtain fell amid thunders of applause, and the two actresses were called
to the front, and each received her share of bouquets.
</p>
<p>“Mr. de Woude, do tell me what the plot is really about?” asked Eline, turning to
Georges. “<span lang="fr">Je n’y vois pas encore clair.</span>”
</p>
<p>But Betsy proposed to go into the <i>foyer</i>, and so they rose and left their box. In the <i>foyer</i>, seated on a divan, Georges related to her the plot of the opera, to which Eline
listened with more attention than she cared to show. Now she knew why Xaïma shuddered
in Ben-Saïd’s presence, and she would have liked to see the auction of maidens in
the first act, and the sale of Xaïma as slave in the second.
</p>
<p>All at once they observed Vincent, who was coming up the steps of the <i>foyer</i>, and approaching them free and unconcerned, as though he had seen his cousins but
yesterday.
</p>
<p>“Hallo, Vincent, have you dropped from the clouds again?” exclaimed Eline.
</p>
<p>“Hallo, Eline; hallo Betsy! charmed to see you once more. Miss van Bergh and Woude,
I think?” and he shook hands with them.
</p>
<p>“I admire your memory; I had forgotten you,” answered Emilie.
</p>
<p>Betsy introduced them: “Mr. de Woude van Bergh, Mr. Vere.”
</p>
<p>“Very pleased. And how are you?”
</p>
<p>“A little astonished,” laughed Eline. “I dare say you are off again to-morrow, aren’t
you? To Constantinople, or St. Petersburg, or somewhere, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>He looked at her, with a smile in his pale blue eyes, like faded china, behind their
<i lang="fr">pince-nez</i>. His features were handsome and regular, rather too handsome for a man, with their
finely-chiselled Grecian nose, the small mouth, about which there generally lurked
somewhat between a sneer and an audacious smile, lightly shaded by the thin, fair
moustache; but the charm of the handsome face was <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>completely spoilt by the unhealthy yellowish tint, and the expression of lassitude
that was suffused over it. Of slender form and delicate proportions, he looked tasteful
in his dark, plain clothes, whilst none could fail to note the smallness of his feet,
and the finely-shaped hand, with its slender, white fingers, the hand of an artist,
and which reminded Eline very much of her dead father. He sat down beside them, and
in a languid voice told Eline that he had arrived at the Hague the previous day, on
a business matter. His last employment had been at Malaga, in a wine business; before
that he had been engaged in an insurance office in Brussels; previous to that he had
for some time been a partner in a carpet manufactory in Smyrna, but the firm failed.
Nothing would do. Now he was tired of all that rushing about; he had given proof enough
of energy and perseverance, but fate was against him; whatever his hands touched seemed
to bring him ill-luck. He expected, however, to obtain a situation in a chemical manufactory
in Java, but he must first have some more information. To-morrow morning he hoped
to call on van Raat, whom he wanted to see. Upon this Betsy asked whether he was coming
to coffee, as van Raat was never at home in the morning, only in the afternoon. He
gladly accepted the invitation, and then commenced talking about the opera.
</p>
<p>“Fabrice? oh, that is the baritone, is it not? Yes; a nice voice, but an ugly, fat
customer.”
</p>
<p>“Do you think so? No; I think he shows off very well on the stage,” observed Emilie.
</p>
<p>“No, Miss de Woude, you don’t mean that.”
</p>
<p>Emilie abided by her opinion, and Eline laughed at their disagreement. The tinkling
of the bell warned them that the fourth act was about to commence, and Vincent took
his leave, although Georges politely offered him his seat in the box.
</p>
<p>“No; thank you very much; I don’t want to rob you of your place, I am comfortable
enough in the stall. <span lang="fr">Au revoir</span>. To-morrow then, eh? Adieu, Betsy, Eline; <span lang="fr">au plaisir</span>, Miss de Woude; good evening, Mr. de Woude.”
</p>
<p>He bowed, pressed Georges’ hand, and slowly went away, lightly swinging his bamboo
walking-stick in his hands.
</p>
<p>“A strange boy!” said Eline, shaking her head.
</p>
<p>“I am continually in fear that he will do something to scandalize us,” Betsy whispered
into Emilie’s ears; “but up to now he has <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>kept himself quiet enough. Besides, you see I want to be nice and friendly to him,
so as not to make him an enemy. I am a little afraid of him, one never can tell what
a fellow like that may do, you see.”
</p>
<p>“I can’t say he is a prime favourite of mine,” said Emilie, and they rose to return
to their seats.
</p>
<p>“Come, Emmie, you only say so because he did not say any nice things about Fabrice,”
Georges chimed in, in a teasing voice.
</p>
<p>Emilie shrugged her shoulders, and they passed into the vestibule.
</p>
<p>“Oh, there is no fifth act! I thought there were five acts,” said Eline, with some
disappointment, to de Woude, who told her the end of the plot.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The fourth act commenced, and Eline felt much interested in the moonlit garden scene,
in Manoël’s cavatina, in his duet with Xaïma, and in the trio with Hermosa; but her
interest grew when the Moorish monarch appeared at the gates of his palace, and commanded
his guard to seize Manoël, whilst, deaf to his entreaties, he dragged Xaïma away with
him, in a sudden burst of passion. The last scene in the opera, where Ben-Saïd is
murdered by the mother, who comes to her child’s rescue, affected her much more than
she would have cared to confess. In his scenas with the two female characters, the
new baritone played with an amount of fire and power which lent the melodrama a glow
of poetic truth, and when, fatally wounded, he sank down on the steps of the pavilion,
Eline fixed her glasses, and gazed at his dark face, with the black beard and drooping
eyes.
</p>
<p>The curtain fell, but the four actors were re-called, and Eline saw him once more,
bowing to the audience with a calm, indifferent expression, in strong contrast to
the beaming smiles of the tenor, the contralto, and the soprano.
</p>
<p>The audience rose, the doors of the boxes opened. Georges assisted the ladies with
their wraps, and they proceeded through the corridor, and down the steps, until they
reached the glass doors, where they waited until their carriage was announced.
</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t think that the <i>Tribut</i> is one of Gounod’s best operas; do you, Eline?” asked Emilie, when they were in their
carriage. “It is not to be compared with <i>Faust</i> or <i>Romeo and Juliette</i>.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I don’t think so either,” Eline answered cautiously, afraid to show how much she
was affected; “but it is so difficult to judge music on hearing it for the first time.
I thought some of the melodies very pretty. But then, you must bear in mind that we
only saw half of it.”
</p>
<p>“Yes; it’s very nice just to go and see a couple of acts; but to have to sit out a
whole opera I think an awful bore, I must admit,” said Betsy yawning.
</p>
<p>And Georges hummed the refrain—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Debout, enfants d’Ibérie.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The de Woudes were taken home first to the Noordeinde, and Betsy and Eline rode on,
snugly ensconced in the satin cushions of the landau, to the Nassauplein. They spoke
a little about Vincent, and then both were silent, and Eline let her mind wander musingly
to the waltz in <i>Mireille</i>, to her dispute with Betsy that morning, to the group of the Five Senses, to Madame
van Raat and de Woude, to her pink dress, and Ben-Saïd.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">About a week after the <i lang="fr">tableaux-vivants</i>, Lili Verstraeten was sitting in the small drawing-room, where the representation
had taken place. The room had long since resumed its usual appearance, and in the
grate burned a cheerful fire. Outdoors it was cold; there was a bleak wind, and it
threatened rain. Marie had gone shopping with Frédérique van Erlevoort, but Lili had
preferred to stay at home, and so she settled herself cosily in a big, old-fashioned,
tapestry-covered arm-chair. She had taken Victor Hugo’s <i lang="fr">Notre Dame de Paris</i> with her, but she did not wish to force herself to read, if she did not care for
it, and the book, in its red calf cover and with gilt edges, lay unopened in her lap.
How nice it was to do nothing except dream the time away! how stupid of Marie and
Freddie to go out in such wretched weather! What did she care about the weather! let
it pour and blow outdoors as much as it liked, indoors it was beautiful; the clouds
subdued the light, the low hanging curtains allowed it but <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>a modest access. Papa sat reading in the conservatory, where it was lightest; she
could just catch a glimpse of his dear gray head, and she noticed how quickly he turned
the pages; yes, he was really reading, not like her, who had taken her book just for
a make-believe. She never felt <i>ennui</i>, though she did nothing at all; on the contrary, she enjoyed those musing thoughts,
rose-leaves wafted along by gentle breezes; soap-bubbles, bright and airy, which she
loved to watch, floating on high, and the rose-leaves blew away, the bubbles broke,
but she wished neither her rose-leaf to be an ivy plant, clinging closely to her,
nor her bubbles to be a captive balloon. Mamma was still up-stairs, ever active—ah!
<i>she</i> could not lighten mamma’s work; she <i>would</i> do everything herself, though Marie occasionally helped a little. She inwardly hoped
no visitors would come to disturb her in her <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i>. How jolly it was! How nice to watch the flame curling and twisting round the live
coal! The grate was a miniature hell, the peat-blocks were rocks, and between them
there were yawning precipices, all fire and glowing embers—it was like Dante! The
souls of the damned hovered about the brinks of the precipices, shuddering at the
fiery mass.… And, smiling at the wildness of her own fantasy, she averted her eyes,
somewhat dazed with staring into the fire. But a week ago, on that very spot yonder,
they had posed before their applauding acquaintances. How different it all looked
then! The scenes, the lyres, the cross, and all the rest of the paraphernalia were
stowed away in the lumber-room. The dresses were nicely folded up by Dien, and put
away in boxes. But it had been a jolly time, what with the consultations beforehand
with Paul and Etienne, the rehearsals, and so forth. How they had laughed! what trouble
they had taken for the sake of a few moments’ entertainment!
</p>
<p>Papa still read on, turning page after page. How the rain beat against the window-panes!
how it rushed down the pipe! Yes; Freddie and Marie were out for their enjoyment …
how grand it was to be snug and safe from all the wet. And her feet sought the soft
warmth of the hearth-rug; her fair head nestled deeper into the cushions of the old
chair.
</p>
<p>Freddie was to go to a dance that evening. How <i>could</i> she stand it, going out night after night! Yes; she was very fond of it herself—a
nice dance, a sociable soirée; but she liked staying at home too; to read, to work,
or to—do nothing. But as for <i>ennui</i>, she <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>did not know what it was, and her life flowed on like a limpid rivulet. She was so
entirely in love with her darling parents; she only hoped things would ever remain
as they were; <i>she</i> would not mind being an old maid.… Quasimodo, Esmeralda, Phœbus de Châteaupers—oh,
why had she not taken Longfellow with her? she did not care about the Cour des Miracles,
but she longed for <i>Evangeline</i> or the <i>Golden Legend</i>—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“My life is little,
</p>
<p class="line">Only a cup of water,
</p>
<p class="line">But pure and limpid——”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">How poetic she was getting! she laughed at herself, and looked out into the garden,
where the dripping bare branches were swaying to and fro in the wind. There was a
ring at the bell, and light footsteps and laughter echoed through the hall. Freddie
and Marie were returning home, they would go up-stairs she supposed; no—they were
coming this way, and entered the room, their wet wraps removed, but bringing with
them a rush of wind and a chill dampness.
</p>
<p>“Well, I never!” cried Marie; “my lady seated by the fire warming herself. That’s
right!”
</p>
<p>“Would my lady like a pillow for her back?” asked Freddie teasingly.
</p>
<p>“Yes; you laugh as much as you like,” murmured Lili with a smile, and she nestled
herself more snugly in the chair. “I am warm and jolly here, and my feet are not cold
and damp. You go and splash in the mud by yourselves!”
</p>
<p>Freddie went to speak to Mr. Verstraeten, and Marie thought she would like a refresher,
and she set about making a cup of tea. So the girls sat down; yes, Lili would like
a cup of tea too, although she had not been out mud-splashing.
</p>
<p>“How dark it is here, Lili! how could you see to read? Why, it’s enough to blind you,
peering away in the dark like this!” cried Marie.
</p>
<p>“But I have not been reading,” replied Lili, enjoying her <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i>.
</p>
<p>“My lady has been musing,” mocked Freddie.
</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Lili with a smile, “it’s grand, doing nothing at all—just dreaming the
time away.”
</p>
<p>And they all three burst out laughing at such a confession of <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>shameless laziness, when Madame Verstraeten came down, looking for her bunch of keys.
</p>
<p>Frédérique said she had to go soon; she was asked to a dance at the Eekhofs’ that
evening, and there were one or two things she had to see to yet, and Madame Verstraeten
thought Lili much more sensible than Freddie and Marie, who were foolish enough to
go shopping in such weather.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Again there was a ring at the bell.
</p>
<p>It was Paul, bringing with him such a marked odour of wind and damp, that he was sent
out of the room again to wipe his feet better.
</p>
<p>“There’s weather!” he sighed, as he sat down.
</p>
<p>Madame Verstraeten left the young people to themselves, and sat down beside her husband,
who, however, on hearing that Paul had come, rose and walked to the back drawing-room.
</p>
<p>“Morning, uncle.”
</p>
<p>“Ah! morning, Paul; how are you?—how is your mother?”
</p>
<p>“Mother is very well. I lift her reading a book that Eline had sent her.”
</p>
<p>“And how is it—have you paid a visit to Hovel yet?”
</p>
<p>“No, uncle, not yet.”
</p>
<p>“But do so then. Don’t delay too long about it; Hovel wants to make your acquaintance.”
</p>
<p>“Paul, it’s four days ago that you said you were going to Hovel,” cried Marie. “How
can you be thinking so long about it? It isn’t such a great journey.”
</p>
<p>“I intended to go to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>“Then go to-morrow, about half-past six. You are sure to find him at home then. I
should advise you not to fail,” said Uncle Verstraeten, and in his usually so friendly
dark brown eyes there gleamed something like annoyance, when he turned to go back
to the conservatory.
</p>
<p>“Paul, Paul,” said Frédérique, shaking her head, “how can you be so lazy? You are
even lazier than Lili.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, to-morrow will be quite time enough,” grumbled Paul, as he finished drinking
his cup of tea.
</p>
<p>“Yes; but you’re very lazy, all the same. And I tell you frankly that we don’t think
it nice of you at all, any of us.”
</p>
<p>“Go on, grandmother, give me a good sermon; that’s right.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Grandmother or no grandmother, that’s my opinion. And you see, I think it’s a great
pity that you should be like that; you could do a great deal more if you only had
a little energy. Mark my words, now, if you don’t better yourself you will grow just
like Henk—a dear good fellow, but good for nothing. You know very well that I am not
altogether in love with Betsy, but I can quite understand that she must sometimes
feel terribly bored with that brother of yours, doing nothing all day long.”
</p>
<p>“Don’t you say anything against Henk now; Henk is a thorough good fellow,” cried Marie.
“And besides,” Marie continued, “you have much more ability than Henk; and that’s
just why I think that laziness and want of energy are doubly inexcusable in you.”
</p>
<p>“Come, Marie,” said Lili, rising, “don’t go firing away like that at Paul, poor boy!
You go to Hovel to-morrow, do you hear?” she whispered in his ear; “then it will be
all right.”
</p>
<p>He laughed, and promised to better himself under the able guidance of the three of
them.
</p>
<p>“And as I have evidently been placed under the guardianship of my cousins and Miss
Erlevoort,” said he good-humouredly, “may I ask if they’ll allow their little protégé
another cup of tea?”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The heavy rain had ceased, but the wind still shook the dripping branches.
</p>
<p>It was half-past five when the door-bell rang once more.
</p>
<p>“Half-past five!” exclaimed Frédérique. “I must go; I ought to have gone long ago;
I have some bows to fix on my dress. Oh! I <i>shall</i> look bewitching to-night, all in <i lang="fr">flot de tulle</i>! Where are my parcels, Marie?”
</p>
<p>“There goes the bell; I wonder if there are any visitors,” said Lili.
</p>
<p>Frédérique was about to go, when Dien came in to say that Mr. de Woude van Bergh was
there.
</p>
<p>“What! <i>that</i> unspeakable bore!”
</p>
<p>“Oh, he’s not so bad,” said Paul.
</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t care; I’m going to close the folding doors. I don’t wish to see him!”
she continued, and she was just about to suit the action to the word.
</p>
<p>“Come, Lili, don’t be so silly; come this way,” said Marie.
</p>
<p>“No, thanks; you go by yourself,” she answered and closed the doors, just as de Woude
entered the front drawing-room, where Marie received him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>Paul and Frédérique laughed, and took leave of Lili, and all three passed through
the dining-room to the hall.
</p>
<p>“Good-bye; give my regards to uncle and aunt, and tell uncle that I shall go to Hovel
to-morrow for certain,” said Paul.
</p>
<p>“Remember me to them also, and tell them I really had to go,” said Freddie.
</p>
<p>“All right; much pleasure to-night in your <i lang="fr">flot de tulle</i>. Boo! how cold it is here in this hall!”
</p>
<p>Paul and Freddie left, and Lili returned through the dining-room. And Georges de Woude,
what had he come for? No; she could not bear him at all. So affected and formal. How
could Paul see anything in him? Paul she thought ever so much nicer and manlier. And
how Marie did lecture him! he was a good boy, too; and what if he were a little lazy—he
had money, and might just as well enjoy himself a little now; later he could look
out for a situation, and he would soon find one, that was certain. Yes; she would
tell pa Paul had promised to go to Hovel to-morrow, and he always kept his word.
</p>
<p>She sat down once more in the old chair, and poked the fire. She warmed her fingers
and rubbed her little hands, soft as satin. Through the closed doors she could hear
the sound of voices, amongst which that of Georges prevailed—he seemed to be telling
them a long story. She must have a look for one moment, and she rose and cautiously
pushed one of the doors aside a little. Yes; that would do; pa and ma she could not
see, but Marie she could just see in the face, and of Georges she got a back view.
What fun it would be if Marie were to catch sight of her; but no, she appeared to
be all attention for that little fop. Lili could just admire his shining white collar,
and the tails of his coat—superfine, all of it! There—Marie looked up—there—she just
caught sight of her through the crack in the door: “Hallo! bon jour;” she shook her
finger at Marie, then she curtseyed and made grimaces, until Marie had to compress
her lips, so as not to burst out laughing.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>As it was getting dark, Frédérique hurried home to the Voorhout. On arriving, she
rushed up the broad staircase. She nearly stumbled over Lientje and Nico, two children
of Madame van Ryssel, her eldest sister, who since her divorce from her husband had
been living with her four children at Madame van Erlevoort’s.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Miss Frantzen, do look after the children, they will fall!” said Frédérique, out
of breath, to the <i lang="fr">bonne</i>, whom she met on the first landing, searching high and low for the youngsters.
</p>
<p>“Do you know where Ernestine and Johan are?” asked Miss Frantzen.
</p>
<p>“No; I have only just come home,” answered Frédérique, quite indignant, and she hurried
further, flew into her room, threw off her cloak, and with nervous fingers proceeded
to open one of the little parcels she had brought with her in her muff and her pockets.
</p>
<p>“I shall never be ready!” she muttered, and she drew aside the green damask curtains
from her bedstead, disclosing her ball dress, spread out on the bed—a diaphanous cloud
of light-blue tulle.
</p>
<p>That morning Frédérique’s dress had been sent home from the dressmaker, but she wanted
to add a bow here and there herself, although she almost feared to touch it, lest
she should tangle the filmy, web-like stuff.
</p>
<p>“Oh, <i>what</i> shall I do!” she cried; then a sudden thought seemed to strike her, and she rushed
out of the room, and on the landing she cried—
</p>
<p>“Tilly, Tilly, Mathilde!”
</p>
<p>One of the doors opened, and her sister, Madame van Ryssel, entered in some alarm.
</p>
<p>“Freddie, what is the matter? why do you scream so? is the house on fire?”
</p>
<p>“No; if it were I shouldn’t call for <i>your</i> help. But do help me a bit, or I shall never be ready.”
</p>
<p>“Help you? what with?”
</p>
<p>“With my ball-dress. I want to put on a bow or two. It’s so bare at the side, and
I bought some ribbon.”
</p>
<p>Madame van Ryssel was about to reply, when the door of Madame van Erlevoort’s room
opened, and the old lady came out to ask what was the matter. At the same moment a
shrill burst of laughter and a sound of children’s voices re-echoed from the landing,
there was a loud tripping of little feet, and a girl of seven came half tumbling down
the stairs, followed by a lad of six.
</p>
<p>“Mamma, mamma!” the child cried, as she jumped down the last steps.
</p>
<p>“I say, Tine, Johan, what a noise you are making! What are you doing, you two?” asked
Madame van Ryssel severely.
</p>
<p>“Jo is always teasing me; Jo wants to tickle me, and he knows I <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>can’t bear it,” panted the girl, and she hid herself behind her grandma’s petticoats,
whilst Frédérique caught hold of Johan.
</p>
<p>“I told you before that I won’t have all that running and noise in the house!” resumed
Madame van Ryssel. “I wish you would remember that grandma cannot bear it.”
</p>
<p>“Never mind,” said Madame van Erlevoort kindly, “they were only playing; eh, Tine?”
</p>
<p>“Look out, do you hear, or I’ll tickle you!” cried Frédérique, and she tickled Johan
under his little arms, so that he fell, struggling and crowing, on the floor.
</p>
<p>“<span lang="fr">Mais comme vous les gâtez, toutes les deux! ne les choyez donc pas, quand je suis
fâchée. Je perdrai tout mon pouvoir, si vous continuez ainsi!</span>” exclaimed Madame van Ryssel despairingly, as she glanced over the banisters, for
down below Madeline and Nikolaas were giving Miss Frantzen a terrible trouble and
would not go up-stairs with her.
</p>
<p>“Lientje, Nico!” cried Madame van Ryssel in her severest tones.
</p>
<p>“Come, Mathilde, do leave the children alone for a moment, and come and look at my
dress!” Freddie implored.
</p>
<p>“I can’t keep them in order any longer, really,” said Mathilde, with a sigh of despair.
</p>
<p>“Make haste, Freddie; we dine rather earlier to-day,” said Madame van Erlevoort.
</p>
<p>The street door was being opened; it was Otto and Etienne van Erlevoort who were coming
home, and their cheerful voices mingled with the laughter and screams of the children,
the chiding tones of Miss Frantzen, and the barking of Hector, Otto’s dog.
</p>
<p>“Come, Mathilde, do just have a look at my dress,” Freddie pleaded, in coaxing tones.
</p>
<p>Mathilde thought it best to give up all attempts at exerting her maternal influence
in that Babel of confusion, and yielded to Frédérique’s coaxing.
</p>
<p>“Really, I mean it, I have no more control over them——”
</p>
<p>“Come, children, don’t fight any more now; be good!” said Madame van Erlevoort to
Ernestine and Johan. “Come with us down-stairs, ’tis enough to freeze you here.”
</p>
<p>Madame van Erlevoort had always been used to excitement and hubbub, and it never seemed
to upset her. Herself mother of seven children, she had always been surrounded by
noisy laughter, <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>turmoil and excitement, and she could not have understood how a large family could
have existed in any atmosphere that was calmer than her own. From the first, her house
had been filled with the shrill voices, the boisterous laughter, and the continual
running to and fro of her children, until they grew up, in all the joyful freshness
of their youthful spirits. Then with the death of her husband, Théodore Otto, Baron
van Erlevoort ter Horze, member of the Second Chamber of the States General, commenced
a period of unwonted calm and peacefulness, which grew even more so when her four
children, one after another, left her house and got married. The first to go was Théodore,
the eldest, who now managed their estates in Gelderland, and who, in the midst of
his numerous family, lived at the Huis ter Horze the life of a gentleman-farmer and
of a youthful patriarch combined. He was followed by her third daughter, Mathilde,
whose brief married life had been very unhappy; after her, the two eldest girls, Cathérine
and Suzanne, left their mother’s home, the former married to an English banker, Mr.
Percy Howard, living in London, the other to Jonkheer Arnold van Stralenburg, Recorder
at the Court of Justice at Zwolle.
</p>
<p>Thus Madame van Erlevoort was left with her two sons, Otto, assistant clerk at the
Ministry of the Interior, Etienne, studying for the bar at Leiden, and her youngest
child, Frédérique; and without the novel charm and refreshing emotions of her grandmothership,
the comparative calm by which she was surrounded would certainly have made her ill
with <i>ennui</i>, used as she was to the tripping of light feet and the song and laughter of clear
young voices.
</p>
<p>A few years after her marriage, Mathilde with four children returned to Madame van
Erlevoort, the children being assigned to her on her divorce from her husband. Since
then, van Ryssel had been living abroad, and little more was heard of him.
</p>
<p>Madame van Erlevoort sympathized deeply with her daughter, who had so long and with
such dignity sustained her part of neglected and misjudged wife, and she received
her with the greatest love, inwardly happy in the new, fresh-budding life which the
four grandchildren had brought into her house. She spoilt them all, as she had never
spoilt her own children. Try what she would to be cross with them, their wildest pranks
failed to provoke her anger, whilst Mathilde they often drove to desperation, for
<span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>she feared what would become of them with so much indulgence. She begged Madame van
Erlevoort not to oppose her when she meted out some well-deserved punishment; Madame
van Erlevoort promised readily enough, but as quickly forgot her promise on the first
opportunity; whilst Frédérique, herself a spoilt child, always thought Mathilde right
in her complaints, but for the rest did little to encourage a firm discipline. It
was only from Otto that Mathilde could now and then expect a little support, and accordingly
it was for Uncle Ot alone that the four young rascals had any respect. With his mother’s
kindliness of disposition he combined his father’s common sense and practical nature,
and in the unruffled calm of his demeanour he appeared older than he really was; but
over his manly features there lay such a charming geniality, there was so much that
was sympathetic and trustful in his bright dark eyes, that his earnestness and his
sound sense attracted rather than appeared too severe in a young man of eight-and-twenty.
Etienne, on the other hand, was all gaiety and thoughtlessness, and his mother’s idol,
in fact her nature seemed to bask in the glow and sunshine of his character. Frédérique
loved both her brothers passionately, but Otto she was fond of nicknaming papa, whilst
with Etienne she would romp about much as Lientje did with Nico, and Tina with Johan.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Madame van Erlevoort wished to dine a little earlier that day, intending to have her
siesta before going to dress. In the evening she was going with Freddie and her two
sons to the ball at the Eekhofs’, whilst Madame van Ryssel stayed at home, a quiet,
saddened young woman, whose smile but faintly lit up her wax-like face, and who lived
but for her children.
</p>
<p>By Mathilde’s express desire, the four noisy customers always dined in a separate
room, with Miss Frantzen. As for Madame van Erlevoort, there was nothing she would
have liked better than to have sat at table with the whole batch of them, Miss Frantzen
included, not caring one iota whether her damask table-cloths were swimming in gravy,
her glass ware broken to bits, or the preserves mauled about by a set of greasy little
fingers. Thus Mathilde had been unable to prevent the children, who dined earlier
and whose meal was over sooner, from running in one after another into the dining-room,
to the despair of Miss Frantzen, whose round face and terrified eyes would then appear
at the half-open <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>door. This sort of thing Madame van Erlevoort in her kindliness having tolerated once
or twice, soon became the rule, and Mathilde was obliged with a sigh to resign herself
to the inevitable. As for Etienne and Frédérique, they only helped to make the youngsters
noisier than ever. Otto also played with them, and Mathilde with a smile shrugged
her shoulders; <i>she</i> could not help it, let things go as they would.
</p>
<p>“No, thank you, Otto, nothing more,” said Frédérique, at the dinner-table. “I can
never eat when I am going to a ball; you know that.”
</p>
<p>“Is it still like that?” asked Otto. “I always thought that it was only very young
girls who could not eat at their first <i lang="fr">entrée</i> into society. Are you still so nervous? Poor girl!”
</p>
<p>“Freddie, what have you been doing to your dress? I hope you have not spoilt anything?”
asked Madame van Erlevoort, with some anxiety.
</p>
<p>“No, ma; I took Mathilde’s advice and did not touch it at all. Ah! you shall see me
this evening,” she continued to Otto; “I shall look quite ethereal in my blue tulle—just
fit to be blown away, you know. Hallo! there they come, the young Vandals!”
</p>
<p>This was meant for the four little van Ryssels, who now came storming into the room,
Nico with an ear-splitting trumpet in his mouth. They came to eat their orange with
wine and sugar. Madame van Erlevoort took Nico next to her and gave him his plate
full of fruit, and ere long the young rascal was sucking away at the luscious morsels,
varying the repast with an occasional blare from his trumpet.
</p>
<p>Ernestine, Johan, and Etienne were picking their hardest from one dish, and amid loud
laughter their forks got jangled one in another, whilst Freddie told Otto who were
coming to the Eekhofs’ that evening.
</p>
<p>“There are the Hydrechts, Eline Vere, the van Larens, Françoise Oudendyk. Don’t you
think Françoise prettier than Marguerite van Laren? Eh, Otto, which of the two are
you going to mash? Oh, Nico! my nerves! Nico!”
</p>
<p>Tootterootoo, too, went the trumpet.
</p>
<p>“Nico, you will drive me crazy with that blaring noise. Put that thing down now, and
eat properly. There, it’s all running down your jacket!” cried Mathilde.
</p>
<p>“Oh, he is only making a little music; eh, little dot?” said Madame <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>van Erlevoort, and she drew her arm round the child, who, without much respect for
his grandma, blew his trumpet right into her ear.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>After dinner Freddie and Etienne romped about with the children, whilst Madame van
Erlevoort retired to her boudoir, and Otto sat down to smoke his cigar beside Mathilde,
who took up some embroidery. Rika, the servant, cleared the table, much hampered in
the process by Nico, and in fear and trembling for the safety of the tray upon which
she had placed the dirty plates and glasses. At last the clock struck eight, and Miss
Frantzen came to fetch the children.
</p>
<p>“<span lang="fr">Ciel de mon âme!</span>” cried Frédérique, half smothered on the sofa between Ernestine, Johan, and Lientje,
and with an effort she extricated herself from the labyrinth of arms and legs that
twined itself about her like an octopus. “I must get up-stairs; Mathilde, will you
help me?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; I am coming,” answered Mathilde, rising. “And you, children, you be off to bed,
quick!”
</p>
<p>“No, I won’t; I want to see Aunt Freddie look pretty first,” cried Ernestine, in a
little whining voice. “And I want to help auntie, too.”
</p>
<p>“Auntie can do without your help, and pretty she always is. Come now, go up-stairs,
all of you, with Miss Frantzen; <i lang="fr">allons</i>, like good children.”
</p>
<p>Freddie ran off, and as Madame van Erlevoort was asleep, Mathilde could for once exert
her influence, and the four of them were bundled off up the stairs, with an admonition
on each step, as Nico wanted to run down again, and Lientje remained sitting on the
floor, playing with Hector.
</p>
<p>“I am coming directly, Freddie!” cried Mathilde; “as soon as the children are up-stairs.”
</p>
<p>Freddie was already in her room, brushing out the wavy masses of her hair. Mathilde
was to dress it: she did it so deftly. And she set about arranging everything—her
fan, her gloves, her handkerchief, her pale-blue satin shoes. A nervous blush suffused
her clear pale face, as she looked at herself in the mirror and smiled, until in each
cheek there formed a little dimple. “Yes; it would be all right,” she said. In half
an hour Mathilde came back with Martha, the chamber-maid, and Frédérique sat down
in front of the glass, in her white under-bodice and blue shoes.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Just as simple and fetching as last time you did it, Tilly,” coaxed Frédérique, as
Martha handed her the comb, the curling-tongs, or a hairpin, as they were wanted.
“Oh! it’s quite cold here! Do wrap something round my shoulders, Martha!”
</p>
<p>Martha wrapt a fur cape about her. With deft fingers, Mathilde had soon completed
her task.
</p>
<p>“There!” said she, and arranged the frizzy fringe in front. “Simple, tasteful, and
fetching—are you satisfied?”
</p>
<p>Frédérique looked at herself, and with the tips of her fingers she just touched her
hair.
</p>
<p>“Rather!” she said. “And now—my <i lang="fr">flot de tulle</i>.”
</p>
<p>The fur cape was thrown on the floor, and Martha arranged the confused mass of garments
which were spread about the room. Mathilde lifted up the cloud of delicate azure,
and light as a sigh she let it glide about Freddie’s shoulders.
</p>
<p>“There’s something fairy, something naiad-like about me!” said Freddie, raising her
arms, and Tilly and Martha knelt down and drew open the folds of silky gauze. “La,
la, la——” and Freddie’s little feet kept time to the tune she hummed.
</p>
<p>“Freddie, Freddie, do be quiet now! Martha, a pin; here, that bow is undone.”
</p>
<p>“How do I look, Martha?”
</p>
<p>“Sweetly pretty, miss.”
</p>
<p>“Doesn’t it look bare at the side, Tilly?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, dear, no; ’tis all bows and ribbons. Come, Freddie, do sit still a moment, now.”
</p>
<p>All at once the door opened slowly, with a creaking sound.
</p>
<p>“What now?” cried Mathilde impatiently, and her anger rose when she caught sight of
Ernestine, shivering in her white nightgown, making her appearance behind the door,
a little frightened, but with an elf-like impudence.
</p>
<p>“Oh, ma, I want so much——”
</p>
<p>“But, Tine, ’tis enough to get your death of cold, running about like that! I don’t
know how you can be so disobedient.”
</p>
<p>“Get into my bed, Tine, quick; but mind my bodice!” cried Freddie. “Never mind, Tilly,
let her alone,” she whispered.
</p>
<p>Tine crept into the bed, and nestled herself like a dove in the blankets, and her
little fingers passed over the blue satin of Frédérique’s corsage, which was lying
on the pillow.
</p>
<p>Mathilde shrugged her shoulders with a sigh, resigned as usual, <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>but the bodice she took away. Madame van Erlevoort appeared in the open door, rustling
in silk moiré.
</p>
<p>“Oh, how nice mamma is looking!” cried Frédérique excitedly; “you will see, Tilly,
I shall be the last again to be ready. Make haste a bit, do!”
</p>
<p>Mathilde laced in the satin bodice, and Madame van Erlevoort smiled in admiration
at her airy Undine. But what was that shuffling sound behind her? Looking round, she
caught sight of Johan and Lientje, both numbed with cold, and in their nightgowns.
</p>
<p>“No; this is really too bad. ’Tis enough to drive one mad,” cried Mathilde, and she
left Frédérique standing with her bodice half-laced, and rushed away to the young
rascals. “How <i>can</i> you be so naughty, all of you, and worry ma so! To-morrow you will all be ill. Come,
up-stairs at once!”
</p>
<p>She spoke with much annoyance, and the children half began to cry; but Madame van
Erlevoort came to the rescue.
</p>
<p>“Never mind, Mathilde, let them stop a little while.”
</p>
<p>“In my bed—get in, quick!” cried Frédérique, laughing her hardest; “but don’t you
touch my tulle; hands off there!” and she drew back in fear from the outstretched
hands of the little Vandals, who were burning to tumble the filmy gauze, and pull
at the long bows.
</p>
<p>Mathilde could see well enough for herself that Freddie’s bed was the best place for
the children, and so for the thousandth time she gave in, as with a sigh she set about
lacing up Freddie’s corsage. Johan and Lientje quickly crawled alongside Tine under
the quilt, and with eyes asparkle with life and fun, they all three sat staring at
the blue fairy.
</p>
<p>“Are you going to put something over all this, auntie?” asked Johan, “or will you
keep as you are, naked like that?”
</p>
<p>“Go on, you stupid boy!” cried Tine indignantly, and she gave him a push, so that
he tumbled over Lientje, and in a few moments Frédérique’s bed was a chaos of woollen
blankets, fair curls, pillows, and bare pink legs and arms, all tumbling and wriggling
about to the accompaniment of loud screams and yells.
</p>
<p>Madame van Erlevoort and Frédérique nearly cried with laughing at the scene, to the
great confusion of Mathilde, who, do what she would, could not manage to get the laces
tied, and Madame van Erlevoort called Otto and Etienne, who in evening dress and overcoats
<span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>were coming down-stairs, to go in and have a look at the scene.
</p>
<p>“Get in here with us, Uncle Eetje; come along, do!” screamed Johan; but Etienne declined
the honour; he was much too pretty now to romp about like that.
</p>
<p>“You look like a fairy queen, Freddie!” said Otto smiling; “fit to——”
</p>
<p>“To be blown away, eh? But, Tilly, aren’t you finished yet with those laces?”
</p>
<p>“Well, Freddie, you won’t stand still for one minute.”
</p>
<p>At last Tilly was ready, every one was ready, and Madame van Erlevoort went down-stairs,
as the carriage had just arrived.
</p>
<p>“Now, children, stop in bed, and don’t run about in the cold,” cried Mathilde commandingly,
while Frédérique, with Martha’s help, wrapped her <i lang="fr">sortie</i> about her, Otto took charge of a fan, and Etienne of a glove.
</p>
<p>“Come, Freddie, mamma has gone down-stairs long ago,” said Otto, and he beat the fan
impatiently on his hand.
</p>
<p>“Freddie, haven’t you forgotten anything?” asked Mathilde.
</p>
<p>“I say, where is your other glove, Freddie, or are you only going to wear one?” cried
Etienne as loud as he could, to make himself heard above the noise and the din the
children were making in the bed.
</p>
<p>“Oh! how you are worrying me, all of you!—I have already got it half on, my second
glove! Martha, my handkerchief! Thanks; everything right? Yes? Well, good-bye, you
pets!”
</p>
<p>“Freddie, you have forgotten something!” cried Etienne.
</p>
<p>“What is it, then?”
</p>
<p>“Your umbrella, here.”
</p>
<p>“Silly boy! Mamma is waiting in the carriage, and you delay me with stupidities! Well,
good-bye, Tilly! good-bye, dearies! yes, Otto, I am coming.… Good-bye, Tilly, thanks
for your assistance. Good-bye, Martha!”
</p>
<p>“Much pleasure, miss.”
</p>
<p>“Much pleasure, Freddie.”
</p>
<p>Freddie went, followed by Otto and Etienne. Ernestine sprang out of the bed, followed
by Johan and Lientje.
</p>
<p>“Here, children, come here!” cried Mathilde.
</p>
<p>She threw some wraps about them, shawls, blankets, whatever she could find.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>“And where is Miss Frantzen, that you have all come in here like this?” she asked,
dissatisfied.
</p>
<p>“In her own room, with Nico, ma; Nico is asleep,” said Tine. “Come, ma, don’t be angry,”
and she raised her little arms fondly up to her mother.
</p>
<p>Mathilde smiled, and allowed herself to be embraced.
</p>
<p>“Come away now, all of you, to bed,” she said, somewhat conciliated.
</p>
<p>“There’s a state Miss Frédérique’s bed is in,” said Martha, shaking her head; “I can
just go and make it all over again, naughty rascals!”
</p>
<p>“Good rascals!” cried Lientje.
</p>
<p>Mathilde took her up in her arms, and Tine and Johan followed, stumbling as they went
over their strange garments, and screaming with laughter at the success of their ruse.
</p>
<p>“Hush! hush! or you will wake Nico!”
</p>
<p>Miss Frantzen knew nothing about it; she was sitting near Nico’s bedside, with Hector
at her feet, and engaged in knitting, and was not a little upset when she saw the
caravan approaching. Those naughty children, to slip away slily like that; she was
under the firm impression that they were all nicely asleep in the next room!
</p>
<p>The <span class="corr" id="xd31e1361" title="Source: two">three</span> were put to bed, shivering and numbed, but mad with fun, and Miss Frantzen requested
them not to talk any more, but to go to sleep.
</p>
<p>And Mathilde bent down over the cot of her Nico, lying there with closed eyes in the
blankets, the moist lips half open, and the little fair curls straggling over the
pillow. Pet of a boy he was!… And the rest too, real darlings, terrible worries to
be sure they were, and quite uncontrollable, especially with such helpers as mamma
and Freddie. But still, how happy she was that she had them, the four of them.
</p>
<p>And she bent down and just touched Nico’s little lips and felt his soft, warm breath
on her cheek like a caress, and her tears fell on his forehead, so transparent and
white, so soft .… the darling boy.…

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now and then old Madame van Raat came to drink a cup of tea at her son’s, in the Nassauplein;
she was brought there in her brougham about half-past six, and was taken home about
half-past nine.
</p>
<p>This time Betsy was still up-stairs, probably with Ben, as Eline assured the old lady,
although she knew that Anna the nurse usually put the child to bed.
</p>
<p>She took Madame van Raat into the boudoir, where the soft light of wax candles fell
from a small crystal chandelier on the violet plush of the chairs and couches, and
was reflected through the many-coloured glass drops in the mirror opposite.
</p>
<p>“And Henk?” asked the old lady.
</p>
<p>“Oh, he is still dozing,” laughed Eline. “Stay, I’ll just go and call him.”
</p>
<p>“No, no; let him be, poor boy!” said Madame van Raat. “Let him sleep, and have a little
chat with me, child.”
</p>
<p>She took her place on the sofa and looked smilingly at Eline, who sat down on a low
settee by her side. Eline took the old lady’s thin, dry hand in hers.
</p>
<p>“And how are you? All right? You are looking like a young girl to-day; so smooth I
don’t see a single furrow on your forehead.”
</p>
<p>Madame van Raat allowed herself, as usual, to be fascinated by that caressing voice,
that sunny smile, and sympathetic expression.
</p>
<p>“You naughty girl! to make fun of my old age! Elly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!”
and she threw her arms round Eline’s neck and kissed her forehead. “And how is it
with Betsy? is she not very troublesome?” she whispered.
</p>
<p>“Oh—really, Betsy isn’t so bad; she is only a little—a little hasty, just in her way
of speaking, you know. All the Veres have hasty tempers, I as well; only papa I never
remember to have seen in a temper; but then papa was a man without his equal. Betsy
and I get along splendidly. Of course you can’t help a little bickering now and then,
if you are always together like that; I think if I even lived with you that could
not be helped.”
</p>
<p>“Well, I wish you would come and try it.”
</p>
<p>“Come, I should be much too troublesome to you. Now you <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>think me very nice, because you don’t see me very often; but if you were to see me
every day——” and she laughed lightly.
</p>
<p>“Did you ever see such a girl? Just as if I had a temper!”
</p>
<p>“Oh no, I didn’t mean that; but really, <i lang="fr">au fond</i>, Betsy is an affectionate girl, and I assure you Henk has a charming wife in her.”
</p>
<p>“Maybe; but—but if I had had the choice, I think I know whom I should have chosen
for my son’s wife, Betsy, or—somebody else.” She laid her hand on Eline’s head and
gave the girl a look full of meaning, a faint, sad smile about the pinched mouth.
</p>
<p>Eline felt a little frightened. Madame van Raat’s words called to mind her own old
thoughts; thoughts long passed and nearly forgotten, in which she had felt that sudden
longing for Henk, the vague desire to lean on him for support. Ah, those thoughts!
they seemed so far off and hazy, as though they were but mere ghosts and shadows of
thoughts. They had lost all charm, they even assumed something grotesque, that all
but made her smile.
</p>
<p>“Oh, my dear madam,” she murmured, with her rippling laugh, “who knows how unhappy
he would have been then, whilst now—he is a little under the slipper, ’tis true, but
Betsy has rather small feet.”
</p>
<p>“Hush—hush!” whispered Madame van Raat, “there’s some one coming.”
</p>
<p>It was Henk, who opened the door of the boudoir, and was surprised to find it so late.
Eline laughed at him, and asked him if he had had sweet dreams.
</p>
<p>“You eat too much, that’s it that makes you so lazy in the evening. You should see
what a lot he eats!”
</p>
<p>“There, mother, do you hear how your son is talked to in his own house, even by his
little sis-in-law? Oh, you don’t know what a troublesome child it is!”
</p>
<p>“You had better not say any more about that; your ma won’t hear anything against me,
not even from her beloved Henk—eh? Just you dare to say that I am wrong!”
</p>
<p>She looked at the old lady with so much childlike freshness in her bright eyes, and
in her bearing, and such a warm glow of sympathy seemed all at once to emanate from
her whole being, that Madame van Raat could no longer restrain herself from embracing
her.
</p>
<p>“You are a dear,” she said, happy in the genial warmth of the affection of old age
for the bright sun of youth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>Betsy, when she came down, apologized for having been detained so long, and asked
if mamma would not rather drink tea in the drawing-room—there was more room there.
</p>
<p>“Paul was coming too, later on,” said Madame van Raat, as Eline placed a marble footstool
under her feet. “Then you must have a little music together, Elly, will you?”
</p>
<p>“Yes—with pleasure.”
</p>
<p>Madame van Raat brought out her glasses and her crochet-work, while Betsy sat down
in front of the tea-tray, glittering with silver and china. She talked about all the
doings of the day; of the ball at the Eekhofs’ the other night, which she had enjoyed
very much.
</p>
<p>“And you as well, Elly?” asked the old lady.
</p>
<p>“Yes, first-rate. I had a splendid dance, and the cotillon was very, very jolly.”
</p>
<p>“And you, Henk?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, Henk!”
</p>
<p>Betsy and Eline both laughed. Eline exclaimed that he was much too stout to dance;
a minuet he might perhaps do very nicely, and of course she was aware that was coming
into fashion again. Madame van Raat joined in the laughter, and Henk, quite unconcerned,
sat drinking his tea, when there was a ring at the bell, and Paul entered.
</p>
<p>He told them that he had just come from the Prince-gracht, from Hovel’s; he wanted
to call on him last night, but he had met Vincent Vere in the Hoogstraat, and so he
had postponed his visit to go and drink a glass of wine in Vincent’s lodgings, with
a few acquaintances. Hovel he thought a very nice man indeed, and he had arranged
to begin his work at his office the following Monday.
</p>
<p>Madame van Raat involuntarily heaved a sigh of gratitude that the long-talked-about
visit had at last been paid. The last time she had seen her brother-in-law, Verstraeten,
she thought she could detect something like annoyance when he spoke of Paul, and in
matters relating to her youngest son she depended a good deal on the aid of Verstraeten,
who had been Paul’s guardian during his minority.
</p>
<p>As she heard Paul speaking, Betsy felt as though there was something very incongruous
about the way Henk “fooled” away his time with his horse and his dogs. But what was
she to do? she had <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>spoken to him so repeatedly, and certainly the present moment, with Madame van Raat
there, was hardly the time to mention it.
</p>
<p>“Come, Paul,” Eline cried, all at once, “shall we sing something?”
</p>
<p>Paul expressed his readiness; he rose; Eline sat down at the piano. Every Thursday
they practised duos together, and she already prided herself on her <i lang="fr">répertoire</i>. Paul had never had a lesson, and hardly knew how to play; but Eline gave him a hint
now and then, which he followed faithfully, and she asserted that whatever he might
be able to do with his voice, he owed to her. He opened his mouth properly and kept
his tongue down, but really he ought to take some lessons of Roberts. A fellow couldn’t
be expected to sing without some study.
</p>
<p>“What shall we have? <i lang="fr">Une Nuit à Venise?</i>”
</p>
<p>“Right you are, <i lang="fr">Une Nuit à Venise</i>.”
</p>
<p>She opened a music portfolio, bound in red leather, with “Eline Vere” in golden letters
on the cover.
</p>
<p>“But don’t bring out your high sol so loud here,” said she. “Take it in your medium
register, and not from the chest. It will sound much sweeter. And begin very softly,
swelling here and there; and keep in good time with me towards the end—the refrain,
you know. Now, nicely, Paul.”
</p>
<p>She played the prelude to Lucantoni’s duet, whilst Paul gave a little cough to clear
his voice, and both commenced together, very softly—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ah viens la nuit est belle!
</p>
<p class="line">Viens, le ciel est d’azur!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">His light tenor sounded a little shaky, but still it went very well with the resonant
ring of her pure soprano. It was a pleasure to her to sing together like that, when
Paul was in voice, and would listen to advice. It seemed to her as though she sang
with more feeling when another voice accompanied hers, and that she felt more, especially
in the repetition of such a phrase as—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Laisse moi dans tes yeux,
</p>
<p class="line">Voir le reflet des cieux!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">words into which she infused something of the glow and languor of an Italian’s love.
To her mind the duet assumed a more dramatic form. In her imagination she saw herself,
with Paul as tenor, <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>gliding along in the radiant moonbeams in a gondola on a Venetian canal. To her mind’s
eye she saw herself in the rich dress of a young patrician, Paul in the garb of a
poor fisherman, and they loved each other, and half-dreaming, half-singing, they went
gliding along the water—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Devant Dieu même
</p>
<p class="line">Dire; Je t’aime
</p>
<p class="line">Dans un dernier soupir.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">There was the refrain! She feared—ah, she feared that Paul would break down. No; Paul
kept time with her. That was splendid! and their voices died away in unison—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Dans un dernier soupir.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">“Lovely, lovely, Eline!” cried Madame van Raat, who had been listening attentively.
</p>
<p>“You are in good voice,” said Betsy.
</p>
<p>“Now you must sing by yourself, Eline,” cried Paul, pleased with his success.
</p>
<p>While the duet was being sung, Mina had come in with the papers, the <i lang="nl">Vaderland</i> and the <i lang="nl">Dagblad</i>, and Henk was soon absorbed in them, turning over the sheets as noiselessly as possible.
</p>
<p>“But, Paul, don’t you want to sing any more?” asked Eline. “Something else; or are
you tired?”
</p>
<p>“I had rather you sang alone, Eline.”
</p>
<p>“Oh no, if you aren’t tired, I should like another duet Really, I think it’s splendid
to sing together like that. Would you venture the grand duo in <i>Romeo</i>?”
</p>
<p>“Really, Eline, I don’t know it very well yet, and it is so difficult.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, you knew it well enough the other day; if only you will sing soft and low, and
not force your notes. There—you see, the whole of this passage with your medium register;
don’t shout, whatever you do.”
</p>
<p>With an anxious look he asked her for a little more advice about the piece, and she
told him what to do.
</p>
<p>“Come now, will you venture? But don’t shout; that’s frightful, and—if we do break
down, what of it?”
</p>
<p>“Well, if you like to try, I don’t mind.”
</p>
<p>Eline’s face glowed with pleasure, and she played the soft prelude to the grand duo
in the fourth act.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Va! je t’ai pardonné, Tybalt voulait ta mort!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">she sang, with splendid delivery, and Paul answered with his recitative; then together
they warbled—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Nuit d’hyménée, o, douce nuit d’amour!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Once more the dramatic form of the duo rose before her: Juliette’s departure; Romeo,
in his brilliant dress, lying on the cushions at her feet. And it was no longer Paul,
but Fabrice, the new baritone, who was the Romeo, and she let her head rest on his
shoulder—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Sous tes baisers de flamme
</p>
<p class="line">Le ciel rayonne en moi!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Paul’s voice was growing very shaky and uncertain, but Eline scarcely heard it. To
her imagination it was Fabrice, with his deep voice, who sang; and her song sounded
full and ringing, quite forgetful as she was that she entirely eclipsed the tenor.
</p>
<p>There—there was the warbling of the lark at daybreak, as in alarm she asked—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Qu’as tu donc—Roméo?”
</p>
<p class="line">“Ecoute, o Juliette!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">replied Paul in firmer tones, after his rest.
</p>
<p>But to her it was not the voice of the lark, but the soft tones of the nightingale;
not the first rays of the morning sun, but the silvery gleam of moonlight, and still
it was Fabrice, and still the orchestra resounded in the chords she struck on her
piano, as, without speaking, they sank in each other’s arms. At times, in the brief
intervals, the stern reality dispelled Eline’s vision, and no longer was it the stage
and Fabrice she beheld, but Paul, turning the pages. But again she revelled in the
luxury of her fancies; Juliette saw the danger of Romeo’s prolonged stay, she urged
him to go, and he answered—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ah! reste encore, reste dans mes bras enlacés!
</p>
<p class="line">Un jour il sera doux, à notre amour fidèle!
</p>
<p class="line">De se ressouvenir de ces douleurs passés!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This was a passage in which Paul’s lyrical weakness appeared most; and Eline, awakening
out of her reverie, heard smilingly with what melancholy he repeated it. She felt
ashamed at having eclipsed him in her ecstasy; she would be more careful.
</p>
<p>And she sang the finale less with overpowering despair than with <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>soft languor, so that Paul’s high chest-notes made better effect than at first; but
the vision was gone, the stage, the audience, Fabrice, all had vanished.
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Adieu, ma Juliette!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">sang Paul; and she answered, with a light cry, in which he joined—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Toujours à toi!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">“Oh, how grand to sing like that!” cried Eline in ecstasy, and she rushed to Madame
van Raat, and embraced her with sudden impetuosity. “Doesn’t Paul sing nicely, eh?
Isn’t it a shame that he will take no lessons? You ought to make him.”
</p>
<p>But Paul declared that Eline gave him lessons enough, and that she would be the death
of him with her difficult duos; but Eline again assured him that he had acquitted
himself splendidly.
</p>
<p>Betsy gave a sigh of relief after the stormy parting of the Veronese lovers, which
under the low ceiling and plush draperies of her drawing-room had sounded much too
heavy and loud in her ears. To her thinking it was a terrible hullabaloo! Why didn’t
Eline rather sing something light and jolly from one or another opéra bouffe?
</p>
<p>Eline and Paul having sat down, the conversation grew more general about the <i lang="fr">on dits</i> of the day, the busy stir in the streets before St. Nicholas’, until it struck half-past
nine, when Mina came to say that the carriage was there.
</p>
<p>“’Tis time for me,” said Madame van Raat, slowly rising from her seat; and Eline ran
away, humming as she went, to fetch her things from the boudoir, a fur circular, a
woollen shawl, a cape. She let herself be snugly muffled up by her young favourite,
and carefully placed her glasses and the crochet-work in her reticule. Then she kissed
them all, bending over them with the slow movements of tired old age, and Henk and
Paul assisted her into the soft satin cushions of the brougham.
</p>
<p>The carriage rolled away; and in Madame van Raat’s ears there still resounded the
echo of singing voices; she smiled sadly as she wiped the vapour from the window to
look outside where the snow was lying, dirty and bespattered in the light of the street
lanterns, and thought of the time when she used to go to the opera with her husband.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>Paul stayed a little longer; and then, after a good glass of wine after his duos,
he hurried off. When he had gone Eline went up-stairs to put the room in order a little,
as she told Betsy. It was chilly in Eline’s sitting-room, but the cool air was refreshing
to her cheeks and hands, heated by the faint atmosphere of the drawing-room. She threw
herself on the Persian cushions, raised her hand, and stroked the leaves of the azalea.
And she smiled, whilst her eyes grew large in a dreamy stare as her thoughts flew
back once more to Fabrice with his beard and his splendid voice. What a pity that
Betsy did not care more for the opera! They went but very rarely, and yet she was
so passionately fond of it. Yes; she would give Madame Verstraeten to understand,
in a genteel way of course, that she would not mind being invited now and then to
accompany her; Mr. Verstraeten never went himself, and Madame generally invited some
one or another to a place in her box, sometimes Freddie, sometimes Paul—why not her?
</p>
<p>All at once she jumped up as a thought suddenly struck her; last night Fabrice had
appeared in <i>William Tell</i>. She ran out of her room and leant over the banisters of the stairs.
</p>
<p>“Mina, Mina!” she cried.
</p>
<p>“Yes, miss,” answered Mina, who was just passing along the hall with a tray full of
wine-glasses.
</p>
<p>“Just bring me the papers, if master and mistress have read them, will you?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, miss.”
</p>
<p>She went back and threw herself on the sofa again. And she laughed at herself as she
felt her heart beating with suspense. The idea! what could it matter to her, after
all? There was Mina, coming up the stairs. She brought the <i lang="nl">Vaderland</i> and the <i lang="nl">Dagblad</i>.
</p>
<p>“If you please, miss.”
</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mina,” said Eline indifferently, and languidly she took the papers.
</p>
<p>But scarcely had the servant closed the door behind her when she opened the <i lang="nl">Vaderland</i>, and with sparkling eyes began to look for the art and literature column. Then she
read:
</p>
<blockquote>“THE FRENCH OPERA.
<p class="first">“After his performances in <i>Hamlet</i> and <i lang="fr">Le Tribut de Zamora</i>, no one could doubt that Mr. Théo Fabrice would find favour in the eyes of the subscribers
to the French Opera, and we cannot but <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>wonder that there were even three votes recorded against the brilliant baritone. Again,
in <i>William Tell</i>, Mr. Fabrice gave ample proof of his fitness to fulfil the post of baritone at the
Grand Opera here, and we sincerely rejoice in his appointment. With a powerful and
well-cultivated organ, the artist couples great histrionic ability. In the duo with
Arnold (Act I.) and in the grand trio, in the scena with Jemmy, Fabrice gave striking
evidence of a perfection rarely to be met with on our stage.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>And Eline smiled and nodded approvingly. It was true enough—and she read the article
to the end, rejoicing in his success; and then she turned to see what the <i lang="nl">Dagblad</i> said about him.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ch7" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#ch7.toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ferelyns occupied the upper part of a small house over a grocer’s shop in the
Hugo de Grootstraat. There they lived in a cramped, depressing atmosphere of economy;
Frans had had but little left him by his parents, and he was therefore compelled with
his wife to live on small salary while on furlough. They settled in the Hague, the
city in which both of them had lived since their childhood, where they had first met
one another, where they had expected still to find their former friends and their
old associations, although Frans had expressed the opinion that they would do better
to make their stay in a smaller town. But Jeanne’s father, Mr. van Tholen, was also
living in the Hague on his pension, leading a solitary life, little visited by his
friends, and gradually forsaken by his children, as they married or went into situations.
It was therefor that Jeanne persuaded her husband, notwithstanding their slender purse,
to stay in the Hague. She would be economical, she promised, and she kept her word,
although by nature she was not much inclined that way.
</p>
<p>So they remained in the Hague, in spite of many disappointments. In the four years
that they had not seen each other, Jeanne found her father much aged, more discontented
and irritable than she had known him before. The days of yore were past and gone,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>thought she: her happy youth in the old, sunny home, with her mother and her brothers
and sisters; her innocent pranks with school-mates; her girlish dreams under the lilac
and jasmine in their garden; her engagement days, full of ideal fantasies, with Frans.
The souvenirs which she had hoped to find in Holland were scattered far and wide like
shrivelled leaves, and much as she had longed in the burning Indies for the damp and
fog of her fatherland, she now, bowed down under her disappointments and under her
forced economy, looked forward to a return to that matter-of-fact, easy-going life
she had enjoyed in the Kadoe with her cow, her fowls, and her goat. And yet, plucky
in spite of the thousand and one little troubles that beset her daily life, she struggled
on. Doctor Reyer visited her Dora every other day; but she fancied she saw a nervous
haste in the popular young physician which made him count every minute of his visit.
He stayed a moment, laid his ear on Dora’s little chest, assured her that her cough
was going, impressed upon Jeanne not to allow the child to leave the house, and left
in his brougham, whilst he made a note in his pocket-book with his gold-cased pencil,
and glanced through the list of his patients. Frans, with his severe headaches and
his low fever, he had referred to a physician in Utrecht, to whom he had minutely
described the patient’s case; and Frans had gone to Utrecht and returned, much dissatisfied
at the vague way in which the physician had spoken to him. Whenever Doctor Reyer came
to visit Dora, Frans went out, feeling annoyed with him and his Utrecht physician,
who between them had been unable to cure him; and he buried his headaches and his
continued cold shiverings in a gruff solitude within the four walls of his little
private office on the first floor. Something like a twinge of conscience came over
him when he heard Jeanne up-stairs talking to the doctor; and Dora, in her peevish
little way, was crying in her efforts to escape the ordeal of examination; but he
did not move; all doctors were quacks who could talk very wisely, but could not cure
him when one was ill.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Jeanne conducted the doctor down-stairs, talking the while, and Frans in his office
heard Reyer ask after him, heard her say something and call the servant to show him
out. Then, as the carriage rolled away, she came in.
</p>
<p>“Do I disturb you?” she asked, in her soft, subdued voice.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p>“No, certainly not; why?”
</p>
<p>“Why did you not come up-stairs for a moment, Frans? Reyer asked after you.”
</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>“What is the use?” he said with irritation. “They send you to their Leiden or Utrecht
celebrities, who make you pay a <i lang="nl">tientje</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1596src" href="#xd31e1596">1</a> for a two minutes’ talk.”
</p>
<p>“But what do you want, then? You can’t expect to be cured by magic of a complaint
from which you have suffered for the last two years. I think you ought to do more
for your health than you have done in the three months we have been here. You have
come to Europe for that purpose, have you not?”
</p>
<p>“Certainly; but first I must find some one in whom I can place more confidence than
Reyer. Reyer is a doctor à la mode, a recommendation of the van Raats, very polite
and gentlemanly, but much too superficial and hasty for me. Why, he is gone ere you
have seen him.”
</p>
<p>“But you don’t speak to him frankly. I ask him about Dora and force him to stay longer,
and really, now that he knows us better, he seems to take greater interest in us.
And everybody says he is clever; it is not only the van Raats who believe in him.”
</p>
<p>“Well, I shall see; there’s plenty of time yet. Sometimes you are just like a drop
of water on a stone, continually drip, drip, drip. You are for ever hammering, hammering
away at that doctor story,” he cried, impatient and dissatisfied with himself, and
he opened his writing-case, as though to give her to understand that he had no more
time.
</p>
<p>She went, and gently closed the door behind her. Up-stairs in the nursery she found
their only servant, a young girl of sixteen, in a dirty apron and unkempt hair, making
the beds; while Dora, with the two boys Wim and Fritsje, were playing in the next
room.
</p>
<p>“I will close the door, then you can air the room, Mietje,” said Jeanne, and she closed
the folding doors, and with a smile sat down beside the children, at a table near
the window, covered all over with little socks, pinafores, frocks, all to be repaired.
Oh! what tiresome, wasteful children they were, to be sure! She sighed, and her small
thin hand fumbled about the things, and her eyes filled with tears. Why was she not
stronger? how she <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>would have enjoyed getting through all her household duties! Now she found it so hard
to lift herself out of the listlessness into which she felt herself sinking, as into
a yawning abyss; from the lifeless languor which seemed to encircle her as with velvet
arms; and yet—there was so much to be done she durst not yield herself up to idle
dreaming, nor rake up her old, wide-scattered recollections, like so many burnt-out
cinders, and forget herself in her longing for the illusions of former days. Stern
reality stared her in the face, in the shape of a great rent in Dora’s woollen frock,
and in the washing that was waiting to be counted before being sent to the laundry.
</p>
<p>And yet even now, while her hand went fumbling about the little socks and vests, she
let herself be drawn deeper and deeper into the soft down of her listlessness; she
bestirred herself with no energy to set about her work, and she did not hear the shrill
quarrelling voices of the children.
</p>
<p>She would so gladly have infused a flood of sunshine, a wealth of harmony into her
humble home; but she was no fairy, and she felt herself so weak even now, and already
no longer able to withstand life’s small troubles, so that she dared not hope for
a much rosier future. Indeed, when she thought of the future at all, it was not without
fear and trembling, as a vague terror shaped itself into an indefinable form before
her mind’s eye, so dread and awful that she could find no words with which to depict
it.
</p>
<p>Her head fell on her hand, and now and again a tear dropped on the linen in front
of her. Oh! how sweet would be her slumbers, if but the caress of one who loved her
might be hers, one in whose affection she would have felt herself safe from all danger!
And she thought of her Frans, and how he had asked her to be his in their garden,
under the blossoming lilac; and now she worried him, and had become like a drop of
water on a stone—drip, drip, drip.
</p>
<p>Ah! she knew it; she had not made him happy; she was a great disappointment to him,
but it was not her fault if he thought to find more in her than she possessed; a stupid,
simple, weak little woman, with a great need of much, very much love and tenderness,
and with something of sentimental poesy in her little soul.
</p>
<p>And sighing, she raised herself, and told the children not to make so much noise,
papa was down-stairs and had a headache.
</p>
<p>Then she looked about on the table after her work-basket, but <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>she had left it in the sitting-room, and so she ordered Dora, like a big girl, to
look after her little brothers for a while. She usually spoke to the child as though
she were a grown-up daughter, and Dora often helped her, very pleased that ma found
her so useful. And Jeanne went down-stairs to the sitting-room, and began looking
for the basket, when Frans came in.
</p>
<p>He had heard her coming down-stairs, and wanted to see her for a moment, as a feeling
of self-reproach overmastered him. He approached her unawares, softly, on the tips
of his slippered feet. He took her gently by the arms.
</p>
<p>She felt frightened for a moment, and when she looked up she saw in his eyes that
very tenderness for which she longed, and with a little smile in which there almost
lurked something like fear, he asked her—
</p>
<p>“Are you angry?”
</p>
<p>Her eyes suddenly grew moist, and she nestled her head on his shoulder, and laid her
arm round his neck, and shook her head.
</p>
<p>“Really not?”
</p>
<p>Again she shook her head, laughing amid her falling tears, and she closed her weeping
eyes and felt his moustache on her lips as he kissed her. How quickly he repented
when he had been unkind, and what a luxury it was to forgive him!
</p>
<p>“Come, don’t cry then; it wasn’t so bad as all that.”
</p>
<p>She gave a sigh of relief and clung closer to him.
</p>
<p>“If only you are a little gentle and kind to me—oh, then I feel myself so—so strong,
then I feel equal to anything.”
</p>
<p>“Darling little woman!”
</p>
<p>Again he kissed her, and under the warm love of his lips she forgot the icy cold of
the fireless room, which caused her to shiver as she clung to his arms.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was the fifth of December, and from early morn a mysterious stir and excitement,
a joyous whispering, an anxious stowing away from peering eyes, had prevailed all
day at the van Erlevoorts.
</p>
<p>A little after seven in the evening the Verstraetens arrived; the two cousins, Jan
and Karel, who had taken part in the tableaux, accompanied them; then came the van
Raats and Eline, followed by old Madame van Raat and Paul; Henk, however, and Jan
Verstraeten did not enter the drawing-room, but mysteriously disappeared in a little
cupboard where Marie and Lili had already laid a parcel of costumes.
</p>
<p>In the large drawing-room Madame van Erlevoort received her guests, who met with a
jubilant welcome from the little van Ryssels and from Hector, and neither Mathilde
nor Miss Frantzen could succeed in their efforts to stop the ear-splitting noise.
</p>
<p>“Now, why did you not bring Ben with you?” Madame van Erlevoort asked Betsy, indignantly.
</p>
<p>“Really, madam, Ben is too young; he is only three, you must remember, and it will
be so late to-night.”
</p>
<p>“He could have ridden home with our Martha. It’s a pity; I had something for him just
to suit him,” said Madame van Erlevoort, in a tone of disappointment.
</p>
<p>In the opposite drawing-room, where the girls, with Otto, Paul, and Etienne, were
talking and laughing, there was a stir, and the young van Ryssels looked up with nervous
curiosity. Martha had just come in, and she had smilingly said something to Frédérique.
</p>
<p>“Now, children and all good folks,” cried Frédérique, with a dignified face, “silence!
Santa Claus has arrived and wants to know if he may enter. Do you agree, mamma?”
</p>
<p>They all kept themselves as serious as possible, with many a furtive glance at the
little van Ryssels.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Santa Claus made his appearance in his white gaberdine, and long red cloak
bordered with gold lace. His hair and beard were long and white, and on his head he
wore a golden mitre. With much dignity he made his entry into the room, leaning on
his staff, and his black page behind him, dressed in a costume which those who had
witnessed the recent tableaux at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>Verstraetens’ would probably have recognized. The three women-servants and Willem
followed them by way of rear-guard, and remained in the room looking on.
</p>
<p>The grown-up people all bowed, with a self-conscious smile, before my lord bishop.
</p>
<p>Santa Claus muttered a greeting, and all but stumbling over his immensely long gaberdine,
he walked up to the sofa, where old Madame van Raat and Madame Verstraeten were seated,
surrounded by Madame van Erlevoort, Mr. Verstraeten, Mathilde, Betsy, and Otto. No
one troubled himself to rise from his seat, and Madame van Erlevoort welcomed the
illustrious guest with a most familiar smile.
</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t grandma get up?” whispered Ernestine wondering, as she raised her delicate
intelligent little face to Marie’s. “I thought she would have got up when such an
old, strange gentleman came in.”
</p>
<p>“<span lang="fr">Mais, écoute donc, comme elle est fine!</span>” Marie whispered to Eline, who stood next <span class="corr" id="xd31e1656" title="Not in source">to </span>her.
</p>
<p>But Eline did not hear; she stood laughing with Paul and Etienne at Santa Claus, whose
gaberdine was certainly coming down, and already quite covered his feet, whilst a
streak of fair hair became visible between his gray locks and his mitre.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Now Santa Claus raised his deep, full voice, and as, with an energetic wrench, he
pulled up his gaberdine into his girdle, he motioned the little van Ryssels to come
to him. They did not feel quite sure of the business, but when Santa Claus took one
of the bags from his little servant’s hands, and opening it began to scatter its contents
about, the youngsters’ faces grew radiant with joy, they forgot their terror, and
one and all they threw themselves, tumbling over Hector, on the floor, to scramble
for what they could find—ginger-nuts, figs, nuts, oranges, chocolate.
</p>
<p>“Scramble away, scramble away,” Santa Claus cried encouragingly, “we’ve got a lot
more; look here! Come, you big boys, don’t you want something too?”
</p>
<p>The cousins Verstraeten did not wait for a second invitation, and joined in the scramble.
</p>
<p>“Will you save them for me, grandma?” screamed Nico, and poured a torrent of sweet-stuff
into his grandma’s lap; “then I’ll go and fetch some more!”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Nico, Nico!” remonstrated Mathilde.
</p>
<p>“Never mind,” said Madame van Erlevoort kindly.
</p>
<p>Santa Claus and the little page shook out their big sacks, which had been growing
limper and limper by degrees, and turned them inside out, as a proof that they were
quite empty.
</p>
<p>“Oh, now we are going to the dining-room!” cried Ernestine, and she jumped up and
clapped her little hands with pleasure.
</p>
<p>“Oh yes; to our little tables!” Johan chimed in.
</p>
<p>Every one rose, and they followed the Saint and the children to the small drawing-room,
and the girls giggled at Santa Claus’s falling wig, but the Saint called out to the
servants and Willem—
</p>
<p>“Quick, throw open the doors; make haste!”
</p>
<p>The folding-doors were opened, and the children stormed into the well-lit room, where,
instead of the dining-table, there now stood four small tables; on each of them lay
a name in letters of chocolate, on each of them rose a tower of toys.
</p>
<p>The Verstraetens and the van Raats whispered to the servants, and their gifts to the
youngsters were brought in also, one by one—hoops, whips, balls, tin soldiers, and
a cow that gave milk.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Santa Claus and his little slave took their departure, and as it was close
upon half-past eight, Mathilde considered it time to stop the fun. But even with Miss
Frantzen’s assistance she was not to achieve her object very quickly. The children
got muddled in their attempts to collect their toys and dainties; from Ernestine’s
pocket a shower of nuts fell on the floor; Johan’s tin soldiers could not be got into
their box again, and Lientje with her hoop and Nico with a trumpet rushed along the
room followed by Hector, without troubling themselves much more about the rest of
their property, which was scattered all around.
</p>
<p>“Come, children,” cried Mathilde, “make haste now; ’tis getting bed-time.”
</p>
<p>But they heard nothing; the little van Ryssels, mad with joy, ran up and down, scattering
about in wildest disorder the toys which the others had gathered together, and Frédérique
joined in the fun, and took Nico on her back, whilst he made a horse of her, and struck
her on the back with his whip.
</p>
<p>The little Verstraetens, too, ran after Tina and Johan, along the marble hall, making
a furious stampede with their boots.
</p>
<p>Mathilde clasped her hands in despair. No one took any notice of her. Miss Frantzen
was assisting the servant with the toys, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>the young girls were laughing with Paul and Etienne. Fortunately she caught sight
of Otto, who was speaking to Betsy and Madame Verstraeten, and she walked towards
him and took his hand.
</p>
<p>“Oh, for goodness’ sake, Otto, do help me; the children must really go to bed, and
they won’t even listen to me. Mamma is not a bit of help either.”
</p>
<p>Madame van Erlevoort, in fact, was at that moment in the other room, very busy filling
Lientje’s toy tea-service with milk, water, and sugar, and old Madame van Raat and
Mr. Verstraeten stood looking on with much amusement.
</p>
<p>“Oh, I see; Otto is to act the bogey man again,” he said good-humouredly.
</p>
<p>“No, no bogey man; but really I shall go crazy if you don’t come to my assistance.
Did you ever see such uncontrollable creatures as those children of mine, Betsy? Are
you coming, Otto?”
</p>
<p>Betsy laughed.
</p>
<p>“You had better just go and assert your authority as uncle, Mr. van Erlevoort,” said
Madame Verstraeten.
</p>
<p>Otto accompanied Mathilde, first to Freddie.
</p>
<p>“Come, Freddie, Nico must go to bed. Come, Nico, quick; to-morrow you may ride again
on auntie’s back. Down, Hector!”
</p>
<p>“You have nothing to do with my back, do you hear?” said Freddie; “do you hear, little
grandpapa? Come, Niek, little grandpapa says we must leave off.”
</p>
<p>Nico obeyed, pouting, as he asked for his trumpet. Otto went into the hall, where
he checked the two eldest in their mad race.
</p>
<p>“Come, Tine and Jo; mamma wants you to go to bed now. Don’t be disobedient now, or
you will make mamma cross.”
</p>
<p>“What a lot we’ve got this year, uncle!” cried Ernestine, out of breath.
</p>
<p>Mathilde came into the hall, leading Nico and Lientje by the hand.
</p>
<p>“Just fancy, there was mamma, quietly playing at tea-parties with Tine,” she said,
and her despairing face made Otto smile. “Really if it were midnight, mamma would——”
</p>
<p>“Ma, dear, mustn’t we say good-night first to everybody?” screamed Johan.
</p>
<p>“No, no!” cried Mathilde, quite terrified, and grasped the little <span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>hands close; “I shall wish all the people good-night for you. Thank you, Otto.”
</p>
<p>She gave him a friendly nod, and he nodded back with his genial smile and his frank
eyes.
</p>
<p>And Mathilde took the children up-stairs.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“Then you can bear all that noise and turmoil?” asked old Madame van Raat of Madame
van Erlevoort, and she looked at her smilingly, but wondering, with her sad, lack-lustre
eyes.
</p>
<p>There was a sudden calm after the exodus of the children. They left the dining-room,
where the toys were still scattered about; the apartment was closed, and the guests
went into the double drawing-room, where Madame van Erlevoort poured out tea.
</p>
<p>“Can I bear it, madam? I feel myself live again under it; it rejuvenates me. I need
the life of youth about me. I never spent a drearier time than when my daughters and
my son Théodore were married, and yet I still had three children left me. But I must
see those little beings fluttering about me; there is nothing that keeps one in a
brighter condition like their wild gaiety. May I pour you out another cup?”
</p>
<p>Madame van Raat handed her cup, and envied Madame van Erlevoort her youthful vivacity
with her gray hairs. She compared her with herself, and her own melancholy solitude,
the effect of which she felt doubly keen, after her former life of cloudless happiness,
and her present existence stood out in cruel contrast to the joy-surrounded old age
of that happy grandmamma.
</p>
<p>“And you don’t know how sorry I am that I see so little of Théodore’s six. The boy
is in love with country life, and won’t hear of it when I attempt to persuade him
to come and live in the Hague.”
</p>
<p>“Your daughter in England has only one child, has she not?” asked Madame Verstraeten
and Madame van Stralenburg.
</p>
<p>Madame van Erlevoort bent down to Madame Verstraeten, and whispered something mysterious
in her ear, whilst in reply to Mr. Verstraeten, who nodded to her smilingly, she archly
winked her eye.
</p>
<p>Thereupon Madame van Erlevoort related how the little van Ryssels had placed their
shoes aside the previous evening, when Henk and Jan Verstraeten came in, both smiling,
and Henk with a very red face. Mathilde too came back, and many nice things were related
about the children. All at once there was a furious ringing at the house-bell.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>All eyes turned to the door as it opened. Willem, Truitje, and Rika between them dragged
a big box into the room, towards Madame van Erlevoort.
</p>
<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Frédérique; “that is the box from London!”
</p>
<p>Madame van Erlevoort informed Madame van Raat that every year at St. Nicholas, her
son-in-law Howard sent her a big box containing something for everybody. Willem, armed
with crowbar and pincers, and assisted by Etienne, removed the screws and nails. Every
one was on the watch, and the shower of presents commenced.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Eline made a little heap of her presents. Oh, how she was being spoilt, she declared,
radiant with smiles. From Martha’s hand she took another packet; slowly she broke
the string, cautiously looking about for a seal, or some stray letter or cipher, to
give her a clue to the sender. But she found nothing of the kind, the address ran
simply—“Mdlle. E. Vere.” It was a gray leather case; she opened it, wondering who
could have sent it. Inside the case, resting on the gray velvet, lay a fan of beautifully-carved
mother-of-pearl. She took it up, and slowly opened it; she looked at it in admiration.
</p>
<p>“Bucchi!” she softly said, as she read the name of the painter at the bottom; “Bucchi!”
</p>
<p>The fan was, in fact, painted by the Italian artist, a fantasy of roses and fairies
on a groundwork of ivory satin.
</p>
<p>“From whom can this come?” she said. “How splendid!”
</p>
<p>Every one rose, every one crowded round Eline, who carefully held the fan open, and
the costly gift attracted general admiration. Eline was astonished. From Madame van
Raat she had had a scent set, that she knew; from Henk and Betsy——
</p>
<p>“Betsy dear, must I thank <i>you</i> for this?” she asked, rising.
</p>
<p>Betsy shook her head.
</p>
<p>“Parole d’honneur—not me, Eline.”
</p>
<p>Of course she had had a bracelet from Betsy and Henk; but who, then, sent this fan?
</p>
<p>“Would it be from—Vincent perhaps?” she asked.
</p>
<p>“From Vincent? No, no; what put that into your head now? What young man would make
such a present? Let me look at it.”
</p>
<p>Eline handed her the fan.
</p>
<p>“’Tis really magnificent,” said Betsy.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>Eline shook her head, quite at a loss for a clue. Meanwhile the fan was passed from
hand to hand, and Eline carefully scanned every one’s face, but she could gather not
the least sign from any of them. But suddenly Frédérique raised her head, with a look
of surprise on her face. She quickly recovered herself, and with apparent indifference
approached Eline.
</p>
<p>“May I see the case one moment?” she asked.
</p>
<p>Eline handed her the case, and Frédérique eagerly scrutinized and felt the gray leather
and the gray velvet.
</p>
<p>“Have you got the slightest idea who could have sent me that?” asked Eline, and she
raised her arms in mock despair.
</p>
<p>Frédérique shrugged her shoulders, and laid the case down.
</p>
<p>“No—I really don’t know,” she said, somewhat coolly, and she looked with some curiosity
into Eline’s hazel eyes.
</p>
<p>An indefinable antipathy seemed to her to radiate from out of those gazelle-like eyes,
and to lie hidden in the mock despair at the unknown giver. She cast not another glance
at the universally admired fan, and during the remainder of the evening she was quieter
than ever she had been before.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The torrent of presents had ceased. Madame van Erlevoort asked her guests to leave
her two terribly disarranged drawing-rooms, full of paper, straw, bran, and rubbish,
when Willem once more opened the doors of the dining-room, and the table, ready laid
for supper, looked bright and inviting enough.
</p>
<p>It was a gay and lively supper-party. Mr. Verstraeten kept Madame van Erlevoort and
Betsy, between whom he was seated, amused with his jokes, and Mathilde, next to Betsy,
often joined in the laughter. Henk, seated between his mother and his aunt, wanted
nothing; whilst Otto and Eline were busily engaged in conversation, and Etienne chattered
noisily with Lili and Marie.
</p>
<p>“Freddie, how quiet you are, <span lang="fr">chère amie</span>,” said Paul, as he took possession of a lobster salad, seeking in vain to set his
little neighbour, generally animated enough, a-talking. “Didn’t receive enough presents
to your liking, perhaps?”
</p>
<p>“Quiet? am <i>I</i> quiet? How can you say such a thing?” answered Freddie, and she began to chatter
with an overpowering animation, which sounded like an echo of Etienne’s. But still
there was something artificial about it; her laugh was not always a hearty one; and
every now and then she stole a furtive glance at Eline, as she <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>sat there, brilliant in her beauty, in lively chat with Otto. Yes, there was something
very fascinating about her, something of a siren’s charm; her beautiful dreamy eyes
half closed, as she laughed, while the soft line of her delicate lips faded away in
two small dimples. And those beautiful hands, peeping out so white from amid the black
lace and the dark red bows of her bodice, and that coquettish-looking diamond, one
single brilliant stone, trembling like a drop of crystal in the black tulle round
her throat. Yes, Frédérique thought her bewitching; but still, she could not help
it, she thought her antipathetic; and almost with anxiety her eyes followed those
of Otto, whose glance seemed riveted to the siren.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, she continued laughing and talking with Paul, with Etienne, and
Lili, and Marie, and old Madame van Raat declared across the table that the family’s
arch-elf of fun was thoroughly sustaining her reputation.
</p>
<p>The champagne streamed into the glasses, and Mr. Verstraeten drank a toast to the
ever-youthful hostess, with her beautiful white hair, and thanked her with a kiss
for the jolly evening. Eline and Otto drank together to some toast of which Frédérique
could not catch the words, and which she would gladly have given her best present
to understand; but still she did not ask.
</p>
<p>“Etienne, what a noise you’re making!” she cried, with some impatience, to her brother,
who, with all the strength of his lungs, sang something about—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Buvons jusqu’a à la lie!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">while his glass nearly spilt its contents over Lili’s plate. But when she had said
so much, she was sorry for it; why should not others enjoy themselves, if she could
not?
</p>
<p>The supper was over, the carriages were waiting for the guests, who left one by one,
laden with the presents each had received. Mathilde felt tired, and soon went up-stairs,
whilst Madame van Erlevoort and Otto were packing the presents together.
</p>
<p>“What a state the rooms are in!” said Frédérique, as she kicked a cardboard box aside.
Then she approached the table; ah, where was the fan? Eline had taken it away with
her. Then she kissed her mother and Otto, playfully rumpled Etienne’s hair, and took
her presents up-stairs.
</p>
<p>Slowly she undressed herself, so slowly that the chill air made <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>her shiver. And as she, trembling with cold, crept under her blankets, she once more
saw Eline before her, in all her bewitching grace, in her black lace, smiling at Otto.
It all began to whirl before her eyes, like a confused kaleidoscope—Henk, in his dress
as Santa Claus, with his falling gaberdine, and Jan Verstraeten as the little page,
the box from London, the fan by Bucchi.
</p>

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was a few days after St. Nicholas’ Eve when Eline went out one afternoon, taking
little Ben by the hand. The previous evening she had been, together with Madame Verstraeten,
Marie, and Lili, to the opera, to see <i lang="it">Il Trovatore</i>, and that morning she had asked her old grumbler of a singing-master to accompany
her in
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“La nuit calme et sereine.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He shook his head; he did not care for those bravura arias of the Italian school,
about which Eline was often at variance with him; she thought Bellini, Donizetti,
Verdi most graceful and melodious music, as though written for her ringing soprano.
He on the other hand considered them childish with their rippling airy little tunes,
and was never tired of dwelling upon the richer depth of Wagner. But she had him completely
under her thumb, and he played whatever she wished him to.
</p>
<p>“Come, Ben, walk properly, there’s a good child!” said Eline to the sturdy little
chap. “Come, keep up with auntie. Isn’t it nice to go into all the nice shops?”
</p>
<p>Last evening, when at the opera, during the cavatina of the Comte de Luna, Eline had
an idea rising in her mind. In the window of a photographer’s she had noticed some
portraits of Fabrice in various characters and dresses, and a sudden desire overtook
her to possess one. So now she was on her way to buy one of the portraits. And she
smiled to herself as though she enjoyed the secret pleasure of it, as she pictured
him with his big heavy frame, his fine head of hair, and his black beard. How glorious
to be an actor!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>From Fabrice her thoughts wandered back to her new fan, which she had used last evening.
Betsy thought she had acted very foolishly in taking it with her before she knew the
giver, but she had taken no notice of her sister’s objections; on the contrary, she
thought there was something fascinating in that uncertainty which had a peculiar attraction
for her romantic nature; indeed she had already formed quite a little romance for
herself out of the little incident. Fabrice had noticed her in the Verstraetens’ box;
he was quite captivated by her; in future it was only to her that he sang, and his
heart was filled with disappointment whenever he did not see her at the opera. It
was he who had sent her the fan with its modest superscription, “Mdlle. E. Vere”;
he had seen her use the fan last night, and one time or other he would be sure to
betray himself by a glance or a certain note in his song.
</p>
<p>She smiled at her own romancing, at the wildness of her fantasy. She remembered last
summer at the picture academy to have seen several fans by Bucchi, and now she also
recollected with what admiration she had gazed at them, and how she had expressed
the desire to possess one. Who could have had the delicate attention to meet her in
that desire? With whom had she been to that exhibition? With Emilie de Woude, with
Georges perhaps—surely Georges could not have—or her dancing-master, who had proposed
to her, but whom she had refused? Oh! it was too stupid; no, she would think no more
about it—one day she would know.
</p>
<p>By way of the Parkstraat and the Oranjestraat she had reached the Noordeinde and was
close to the picture-shop, when all at once the thought struck her—would not the shopkeeper
think it absurd for a young girl to purchase such a portrait? No; she would never
summon up courage. But already she stood before the window, behind which masses of
engravings, photographs, groups of statuettes in marble and terra-cotta, and numbers
of various objects of art were displayed in elegant confusion; actors and actresses,
singers and painters, with their names attached: Estelle Desveaux, Moulinat, Théo
Fabrice.
</p>
<p>“Come, Ben,” she said, and gently pushed the child inside. There were some ladies
in the shop, selecting photographs, and they looked at her. She could not help it,
but really she thought she blushed under her white tulle fall.
</p>
<p>“May I see some of your New Year’s cards, like those in your <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>window?” she asked the shopkeeper. “Don’t touch those statuettes, Ben.”
</p>
<p>A number of cards were shown her. She looked at them attentively, took them up with
the tips of her well-gloved fingers, and laid a few aside. Then she looked round her,
noticed a heap of portraits, and with her languid indifference she took them up. Fabrice’s
were among them.
</p>
<p>Which should she take? This melancholy-looking one in the black velvet costume and
lace collar, representing Hamlet; that one as Tell? No, this one, as <span class="corr" id="xd31e1812" title="Source: Ben-Säid">Ben-Saïd</span>, the character in which she had first seen him. But she would also take that one
of Moulinat, the tenor, and of Estelle Desveaux, the contralto; then it would not
be remarked that she had come expressly for Fabrice. But then she might just as well
take another of Fabrice, as Hamlet.
</p>
<p>“Will you let me have these cards, and these four portraits?”
</p>
<p>“Shall I send them to you?”
</p>
<p>“Oh no, I will take them. How much is it altogether?”
</p>
<p>She paid the money, took the envelope in which the shopman had enclosed them, and
left the shop with Ben, under the firm impression that the ladies, who were still
engaged with the photographs, looked at her as though they would read her inmost thoughts.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>A glow of pleasure came over Eline’s face when once she was outside. At last she had
summoned up courage to do what she had long determined, and she spoke in a gentle
motherly way to Ben. And when, on reaching the Hoogstraat, she saw Jeanne Ferelyn
in her winter cloak, wide as a sack, and her modest little black hat, walking on the
opposite side without noticing her, she took Ben’s hand, and quickly crossing the
street between two carriages, greeted Jeanne with smiling cordiality. They walked
on a few steps together, Jeanne telling her that Dora was getting on nicely, but that
she had been obliged to engage a nursemaid, as she could not always leave the children
to the care of Mietje, who was so slovenly and careless, and that it had somewhat
crippled her finances. Eline forced herself to be attentive to the tale of her latest
troubles; but soon Jeanne began to speak with more animation about Frans, her father,
and Doctor Reyer, with whom she was getting on better now. Then as she saw how sympathetically
Eline looked at her, and how gently she spoke to Ben, she raked <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>up some of the recollections of her school-days, and they laughed about their childish
pranks, and about the cherries she used to pick out of Eline’s cape. Jeanne was annoyed
at herself for having formed such an unfavourable impression of Eline when she met
her at the van Raats’ dinner-party; now she found her quite unaffected and amiable.
</p>
<p>“But don’t let me detain you any longer, Eline,” said she, stopping short; “I have
to make a few trifling purchases, order some saucepans, and a milk-jug. Mietje has
been breaking some things.”
</p>
<p>“Oh! I have nothing to do, I’ll walk with you so far, if you don’t think I’m <i lang="fr">de trop</i>, and if Ben isn’t tired. Are you tired, little man? No, eh? Oh! he is such a good
one at walking!”
</p>
<p>They walked on, and Jeanne ordered the saucepans, and Eline went into the china-shop
and chose a milk-jug for her. At the same time her mind was still running on Fabrice,
and at times she felt an irresistible longing to open the envelope and look at his
portraits. She was so passionately fond of music, and Fabrice sang with such pathos,
with so much more feeling than other actors. He was still young, she thought; he would
yet be famous, and make his <i lang="fr">début</i> in Paris. Jeanne never went to the opera, and probably had never yet seen him.
</p>
<p>Would she, Eline, meet him one day in the street, she wondered? And how would he look,
in his everyday clothes? Yes; one morning she would pretend to have an early call
to make somewhere, and she would pass by the opera-house. Perhaps there might be a
rehearsal, and if so she would probably meet some of the artistes in the neighbourhood
of the building. Absorbed in her own thoughts she did not always hear what Jeanne
was saying; but she continued to look at her, as she walked by her side, with those
sympathetic eyes and that winning smile, which were among Eline’s greatest charms.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile they had turned the corner, and on reaching the Hoogewal, she took leave
of Jeanne.
</p>
<p>“Well, good-bye, I’ll come and look you up soon, Jany; remember me to Ferelyn, do
you hear? Come, Ben, shake hands with the lady.”
</p>
<p>In her longing after affection, Jeanne felt something like a grateful glow of warmth
at the sound of that name Jany; it seemed like an echo of former days, when as a girl
every one called her Jany.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>And she hurried back to the Hugo de Grootstraat, full of high spirits, longing once
more to be in her little home, with her husband and her little darlings of children.
</p>
<p>Eline smiled to herself as she passed through the Willemspark on her way home. The
bare branches over her head glistened with hoar frost, and the frigid air was clear
and seemingly full of vague echoes. She felt a strong impulse to give expression to
her happiness in that free atmosphere, by an outburst of joyous song. Was she a little
smitten then—with that——
</p>
<p>No, no, it was too absurd; it was only that he sang well!

<p class="first">The flaming fire cast great, quivering shadows, like dancing, black spectres, on the
walls and ceiling of the dark room. Now and then a momentary flash of brightness would
hover about an antique silver ewer, or glint along a carved sideboard, which, like
a vague dark mass, filled up an angle in the room, or play about a set of old china,
or a pair of antique vases over the mantelpiece.
</p>
<p>Vincent Vere lay stretched on his sofa, and looked around with half-closed eyes, each
time there was a flickering of light over the room. That strange prevailing gloom,
penetrated by fitful gleams of ruddy light, made him pleasantly forgetful of his prosaic
rooms, where a stray object of <i lang="fr">vertu</i> of his own was in screaming contrast with the shabby gentility of the furniture.
And he lay musing awhile in the Dantesque twilight.
</p>
<p>These last few days he had felt very worn and exhausted. A languor seemed to numb
his limbs; it was as though it were warm water instead of blood that coursed through
his veins; at times a mist seemed to hang before his eyes, so that he could neither
act nor think. His eyelids drooped wan and limp over his lack-lustre, light blue eyes;
his lower lip hung down heavily, and about his small mouth there was a very pained
expression. He had often felt like that, but this time he ascribed it to the atmosphere
of the Hague, which well-nigh suffocated him, and he longed for more space and more
air, and could not understand why he should have <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>gone to a city, which had always had so little attraction for him. Yes, he remembered—through
the mist of his exhaustion—he had wished for a span of rest, after all his restless
wanderings; but already, notwithstanding his fatigue, he felt a nervous stimulation
to action, and an inward spur once more to throw himself into a vortex of change.
Rest and monotony had a dulling effect upon him, and in spite of his weakness he felt
continually excited to movement and action, and an insatiable longing for an ever-changing
horizon. And yet he lacked the energy to devote himself with determination to any
kind of labour, whilst his changeable nature constantly drove him onward in a restless
search after some surroundings, some sphere or occupation in which he might feel at
home, and which he ever failed to find.
</p>
<p>The two weeks which he had spent in the Hague seemed to him an age of <i>ennui</i>. The day after he had met Betsy and Eline at the opera, he had been to take coffee
at the van Raats’, and had asked Henk to lend him 500 florins; he was daily expecting
some money from Brussels, he said, and he would repay him at the very first opportunity.
Henk, though he knew him to be exceedingly forgetful in such matters, did not like
to refuse, and handed him the amount, and so Vincent lived on, one day allowing the
money to run as water through his fingers, the next with parsimonious economy hesitating
to spend a <i lang="nl">dubbeltje</i>, while the drafts from Brussels continued to stay away.
</p>
<p>About the future he troubled himself but little; he had ever led a hand-to-mouth existence;
he had known days of luxury in Smyrna, and suffered privation in London and Paris;
but in whatever circumstances he might have found himself, that feverish desire for
change had spurred him on, in continual dissatisfaction with the present; and at that
moment, while he was living on his 500 florins, he felt so unnerved that the very
burden of his listlessness at times almost made him forget his weakness.
</p>
<p>Then he mused on, gazing into the darkness, now and again lit up by the ruddy flames,
as they shot forth from the hearth and fell in spectral relief about the gloom-hidden
furniture. He mused on, in coldest pessimism. Why should he be other than he was?
He would again want money, and he would get it somehow; why not? There was neither
good nor evil in the world; everything was as it should be, and the inevitable result
of an unbroken <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>chain of causes and reasons; everything that was had a right to be; no one could alter
that which was, or was to be; no one had a free will; every one was only a different
temperament, and no one could act in any way but in accordance with the demands and
nature of that temperament, influenced by circumstances and surroundings; that and
that alone was truth, yet mankind with its childish idealism, eternally prating about
virtue, and provided with a handful of religious poesy, was ever seeking to hide it.
</p>
<p>“Great heavens! what a life it is!” he thought, and his fingers wandered about his
light brown curls. “The life at least that I am leading now, for a year of it, would
kill me, or drive me mad. To-morrow is like to-day, nothing but one blank monotony.”
</p>
<p>And he threw himself into an ocean of memories, as he thought of what he had lived
through, and scenes in many climes and pictures of various cities rose before his
mind.
</p>
<p>“And yet, what a struggling, what a toiling for nothing at all,” he muttered, and
his eyes closed, whilst swiftly a veil appeared to descend over his memory, and light
drops of perspiration formed on his brow. There was a singing in his ears, and suddenly,
a vague space, terrible in its extent, unrolled before his closed eyes.
</p>
<p>But this state of weakness, bordering almost on a swoon, lasted only a few seconds;
and a deep sigh escaped his bosom.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>There was a noise of rapid footsteps up the stairs, and a cheerful voice was heard
exchanging a word of greeting with the lady in the fancy shop below. He was expecting
a few acquaintances that evening.
</p>
<p>The door opened.
</p>
<p>“The deuce, how dark it is! It looks like hell here, with that terrific fire. Where
are you hiding, Vere?” cried Paul van Raat, standing by the open door.
</p>
<p>Vincent rose and walked towards him, and grasped Paul by the shoulders.
</p>
<p>“Here, old chap, don’t be alarmed. Wait, I’ll light the lamp.”
</p>
<p>He sought some matches, lit a couple of old-fashioned lamps on the mantelpiece, and
blinked his eyes, dazzled by the sudden light. The Dantesque halo that hung over the
room was soon dispelled by the yellow petroleum light, but the bright burning fire
still looked sociable, although the antique sideboard with the silver ewer and <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>a few Oriental objects of art looked sorely out of place among the old-fashioned furniture
in threadbare red Utrecht velvet, and the antique pieces of china seemed like so many
misplaced aristocrats among the ugly, cheap engravings and common oleographs which
lined the walls.
</p>
<p>It was the first time that Paul had entered Vincent’s abode, and he looked admiringly
at the ewer and the china plates.
</p>
<p>“Yes, they are not bad; the ewer is cracked, but the workmanship is very fine, do
you see? I called upon an old Jew dealer to-day; I want to get rid of the things.
You see, they only take up the room. He was going to call to-morrow. Or perhaps <i>you</i> would like them? They are to be had.”
</p>
<p>“No; my room—or my studio, if you like—is too full already.”
</p>
<p>“Well, a few plates more or less——”
</p>
<p>“No; thank you.”
</p>
<p>“After all, I would rather sell them to the Jew. Perhaps I can manage to best him
a bit, and, of course, I should not care to do that to you.”
</p>
<p>“Much obliged. And suppose he is too sharp for you?”
</p>
<p>“Well, then he must best me, that’s all. It’s always thus in the world, isn’t it?
You have had tea, I suppose?”
</p>
<p>“Yes—no, thank you; never mind. But, tell me, how long are you going to stay in the
Hague?”
</p>
<p>They sat down, and Vincent shrugged his shoulders. He really did not know; he had
not yet received any information about the situation in the quinine factory in Java;
but he heard they would give the preference to a chemist, which he was not. So he
would most likely give up the idea; and, besides, he didn’t think the Indian climate
would agree with him. In the meantime, staying in the Hague, to find something there,
was out of the question. He was already getting tired of the Hague—it was so <i lang="de">kleinstättig</i>; every one knew every one else, at least by sight, and everywhere he met the same
people, intensely tiresome! He had not yet made up his mind what to do, but he was
expecting letters and remittances from Brussels. And he concluded by asking Paul if
he could lend him a hundred gulden for a day or two. Paul thought he could manage
it, but he could not yet say for certain.
</p>
<p>“You would really be doing me a service; shall I hear from you then to-morrow? or
do you think me indiscreet?”
</p>
<p>“Oh no; not at all. Yes, all right, I shall see to-morrow.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Well, thanks in advance. You know the two Erlevoorts and de Woude are coming this
evening. I have asked them to come and drink a glass of wine,” said Vincent, in an
altered tone.
</p>
<p>“Yes; I saw them this afternoon at the Witte,” answered Paul.
</p>
<p>Vincent leant back against the old red bench, and the lamp-light cast a yellowish
reflection on his sallow features, and a care-worn expression formed about his mouth.
Paul was struck by Vere’s remarkable resemblance to his uncle Vere, Eline’s father,
as he lay back, and raised his arm behind his head, with a gesture such as he had
frequently remarked in Eline.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>A little later, some time after nine, Georges de Woude van Bergh and Etienne van Erlevoort
came, the latter apologizing for his brother, who had been prevented from coming.
</p>
<p>Otto felt no sympathy for Vincent, although he had never had any unpleasantness with
him whatever; with his own practical, manly character never disturbed in its healthy
equilibrium, with his hearty brusquerie, he could cherish no friendship towards a
man who, in his opinion, gave himself completely over to a morbid, hyper-sensitiveness,
without making the slightest effort to raise himself out of it. Otto was one of the
few persons whom Vincent could not succeed in drawing towards him. Almost every one
on coming into contact with him felt conscious of something that repelled even while
it attracted; something like a sweet, alluring poison, like the overpowering fumes
of opium. His continued travelling had given Vincent a good deal of knowledge of human
nature, or rather of tact in dealing with all sorts of people, and he could, when
he chose, assume any character to suit the circumstances, with the same ease as a
serpent writhes itself into various coils, or as an actor interprets various <i lang="fr">rôles</i>. But Otto, with an involuntary pride in his own healthy strength, which ever went
straight at its object, despised Vincent, because of the poisonous fascination which
he had the power to shed about him, and the seduction of which others were unable
to resist.
</p>
<p>Ere long a bluish smoke filled the room, Vincent having offered cigars round, although
he himself did not smoke. He took a couple of bottles of St. Emilion from a cupboard,
uncorked them, and placed four glasses on the table. Etienne, with his usual spirits,
sat relating story after story, with an amount of mimicry and gesture, <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>and a strong flavouring of youthful patois, that gave him somewhat the air of a singer
at a <i lang="fr">café chantant</i>. Paul and Georges laughed. But Vincent shrugged his shoulders, with a <i lang="fr">blasé</i> smile, and as he filled the glasses muttered contemptuously, in his light voice—
</p>
<p>“What a baby you are, Eetje, Eetje!”
</p>
<p>Etienne, however, took no notice of the remark, and continued his stories, growing
more and more spicy as he went on, whilst the others listened and enjoyed the bouquet
of their wine. But Vincent could not resist the temptation to chaff him.
</p>
<p>“What a naughty boy that young Erlevoort is to talk about such things, eh? What a
sad dog!” he said, and the mocking laugh about his mouth was too encouraging that
Etienne should desist.
</p>
<p>Vincent once more filled the glasses, and Georges praised the wine. He had never very
much to say when amongst young men; he generally gave himself up to quiet enjoyment.
It was only for the society of ladies that he reserved all the sparkle of his brilliant
wit. Vincent asked him one or two questions about his work at the ministry for foreign
affairs.
</p>
<p>“I suppose you will be attached to some legation or other one day?” he said.
</p>
<p>“Very likely,” answered Georges.
</p>
<p>“Well, at all events, it is a situation which gives you the chance of seeing something
of the world. But how any one can pass his whole life in an office, I can’t conceive.
It would kill me<span class="corr" id="xd31e1941" title="Not in source">.</span> There’s Erlevoort, now—I mean your brother, Eetje.”
</p>
<p>“You let Otto alone,” said Paul. “He has a great career before him, you shall see.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, you know, Otto is cut out for a cabinet minister or a governor-general—at least,
so his mother always says. ’Tis I alone who am the outcast of the family,” cried Etienne.
</p>
<p>“Yes; the spoilt child, eh?” laughed Vincent “How far are you now in your studies?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m going on all right. I am not at college, you know, I am studying in the Hague.”
</p>
<p>“Do you think it so enjoyable in the Hague, then, in July?” asked Vincent, in a tone
of contempt.
</p>
<p>“Yes; it’s not so bad.”
</p>
<p>“How, in Heaven’s name, is it possible? You fellows are very <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>easily satisfied then, I must say, or rather you haven’t any idea of what the world
is like. The Hague makes me sleepy and dull, there’s something drowsy in the atmosphere.”
</p>
<p>“That’s your own doing, I dare say,” laughed Paul.
</p>
<p>“Possibly; and maybe ’tis my fault too that I think the life you fellows lead here
too soul-killing. Now what is it you are doing here, I should like to know? You are
continually running about in one little circle, like a horse in a roundabout at the
<i lang="nl">Kermis</i>. Should you be in a situation, you have always exactly the same little jobs to do,
and when you have done, the same little amusements await you in the evening. Great
Scott! how insipid!”
</p>
<p>“But what is it you would have us do then?” asked Georges.
</p>
<p>“As far as I am concerned you can go on vegetating here, if you like; but I can’t
understand you fellows not even wanting to see something of the world.”
</p>
<p>“Well, now there’s yourself; you have seen the world, as you call it, haven’t you?
and what have you gained by it? you are a Jack-of-all-trades, and a master of none;
and up to now you haven’t achieved any very brilliant results!” cried Paul, a little
out of humour at the contemptuous way in which Vincent had referred to him.
</p>
<p>Behind his eye-glass an angry gleam shot forth from Vincent’s dull blue eyes, whilst
his thin lips closed.
</p>
<p>“And you are forgetting your duties as a host, with your philosophizing,” cried Etienne,
pointing to his empty glass.
</p>
<p>“I suppose the fact is that I am of a more excitable temperament than you fellows,”
said Vincent, in a languid voice. He again filled up the glasses, and sank down wearily
beside Georges, and his eyes wandered listlessly about the room.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>It was growing very warm, and the tobacco smoke hung in thick clouds about the ceiling.
Vincent opened the door. Etienne, who could not take much wine, had become very excited,
there were red circles about his eyes, and he had broken his glass. Georges and Paul
continued to enjoy his jokes. Vincent, however, listened to him with a faint smile.
</p>
<p>And in his mind there arose a strange wondering, a wondering that a man always retained
his own individuality, without the power of transforming himself into the personality
of any one else. Often, without the slightest cause, he would find himself lost in
<span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>wonder at this idea, in the midst of the most cheerful company, and he would be filled
with an indescribable feeling of <i>ennui</i> at the thought of his inevitable fate ever to remain what he was—Vincent Vere; that
he never could be transformed into some entirely different being, which would breathe
under entirely different circumstances and in an entirely different sphere. He would
have liked to have lived through various phases of life, to have existed in different
ages, and to have sought his happiness in constantly changing metamorphoses. And this
desire appeared to him at the same time very childish, because of its ridiculous impossibility,
and very noble because of the grandiose unattainability which it involved; and he
believed that no one but him cherished such a desire, and thought himself very much
exalted above others. In his musings it seemed to him as though the three others were
very far removed from him, as though they were separated from him by the smoky haze.
A feeling of lightness suddenly passed through his brain; it was as if he saw every
object in brighter colouring, as if their laughter and chat sounded louder and more
metallic in his ear, as if the flavour of the tobacco, mingled with the aroma of the
wine, assumed a more pungent odour, whilst the veins in his temples and pulse throbbed
as if they would burst.
</p>
<p>This excitement of his nerves continued for a few seconds, then he saw his guests
laughingly looking at him, and although he had not understood a word of what they
said, he also laughed lightly, that they might think that he shared their amusement.
</p>
<p>“I say, Vere, ’tis getting confoundedly close here, my eyes ache with the smoke,”
said Georges; “couldn’t we open a window?”
</p>
<p>Vincent nodded his head and closed the door, whilst Paul, who sat by the window, opened
it. A rush of cool air quickly entered. Outside it was very quiet; now and again voices
might be heard to the accompaniment of measured footsteps, or a shrill street tune
re-echoed through the stillness.
</p>
<p>The chill air brought Vincent quite to himself again, and his strange desires vanished,
now that his nerves grew calmer. Now, on the contrary, he envied the three that same
physical and moral Nirvana which he had looked upon with such contempt a short while
since; Paul he envied his vigorous health, just a trifle enervated by a somewhat languid
æstheticism; Georges his calm equanimity and contented mind; Etienne his joyous youthfulness.
Why indeed was he not like them, healthy, contented, and youthful? <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>why did he not enjoy life as it was? why was he continually seeking after a something
which he could not even define himself?
</p>
<p>It was close upon one when the three young men rose, and Paul declared that they would
have to take Etienne home, as his early excitement had given way to a mood of melancholy,
and he was continually talking about suicide.
</p>
<p>“I say, Eetje, have you got your key?” he asked.
</p>
<p>“Key?” asked Etienne with dull staring eyes, and husky voice. “Key?” he repeated,
reflecting. “Yes, in my pocket, yes—a key—in my pocket—here——”
</p>
<p>“Come, let us go then,” said Georges.
</p>
<p>Etienne approached Vincent and took him by the shoulders, while the others listened
in amusement.
</p>
<p>“Good-bye, Vere, thanks for your hospi—hospitality. I always had a liking for you,
Vere; you’re a trump of a fellow, do you hear, Vere? I feel much, very much sympathy
for you, do you hear? Only this afternoon at the Witte I was saying—Paul was there—and
heard me—I said, Vere, that your heart was in the right place. They misjudge you,
Vere, but——”
</p>
<p>“Come, <i lang="fr">allons</i>!” cried Paul and Georges, with impatience, taking hold of his arm; “cut it short.”
</p>
<p>“No, no; let me have my say—they misjudge you, Vere; but don’t you take any notice
of it, old boy; ’tis just the same with me, they misjudge me too. ’Tis sad, very sad,
but so it is; good-bye, Vere; good-night, Vere; sleep well.”
</p>
<p>Vincent saw him to the door with a lighted candle, and Etienne walked to the steps,
supported between Georges and Paul.
</p>
<p>“Vere, be careful now. Don’t catch cold standing at the door, and don’t you take any
notice; they misjudge you, but I will take your part——”
</p>
<p>Vincent nodded smilingly at Georges and Paul, and closed the door.
</p>
<p>“Deuced pleasant chap, that Vere!” stammered Etienne.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After four o’clock the Verstraetens were generally at home, and to-day about that
time the house happened to be stormed with visitors. Betsy and Eline had just looked
in, and met the Eekhofs, and the Hydrechts, Emilie de Woude, and Frédérique; later
on came Madame van der Stoor and little Cateau.
</p>
<p>Eline, with her hand on Cateau’s shoulder, bent over the photograph at which the latter
was looking.
</p>
<p>She felt conscious of a strong impression on Cateau by her grace and geniality, and
as, in her need for affection, she was always glad to create sympathy, she nurtured
Cateau’s love as a precious flower. But that longing for affection was not unmingled
with a touch of proud triumph towards Frédérique, in whom, ever since St. Nicholas’
Eve, she suspected, she knew not why, a secret aversion towards herself.
</p>
<p>While Cateau was speaking to her, in her pleasant little voice, Eline just glanced
round at Frédérique in order to see if she noticed the sympathetic admiration of her
little friend. But Frédérique was too much engaged joking with the young Eekhofs.
</p>
<p>“You often sing with Mr. van Raat; has he a nice voice?” asked Cateau.
</p>
<p>“A little weak, but very pretty.”
</p>
<p>“Oh! I should so much like to hear you together.”
</p>
<p>“Well, I dare say you will some day.”
</p>
<p>“You have such a splendid voice; oh! I think it so delightful to hear you sing.”
</p>
<p>Eline gave a little laugh, flattered by Cateau’s ecstasy.
</p>
<p>“Really? But, Toos, don’t go on calling me Miss Vere, ’tis so formal; call me Eline
in future, will you?”
</p>
<p>Cateau blushed with pleasure, and stroked the fur of Eline’s muff. She gave herself
completely over to the charm of that melodious voice, to the fascinating influence
of that soft, gazelle-like glance.
</p>
<p>Eline felt more than usually in need of much affection and tenderness. In her innermost
heart, her admiration for Fabrice had blazed forth in a passion that filled her whole
being, and to which she felt constrained to give vent, without betraying herself.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>The wealth of love which she felt was in her, and which she durst not proclaim, she
attempted to share amongst those who were worthy of it, like a costly bouquet of which
she threw a flower to those around her. Those chosen ones she beamed upon with her
captivating glance, and was enraptured when she saw that others felt themselves drawn
towards her; but on the other hand it gave her pain when she was met with coldness
in return. Thus it was with Frédérique’s inexplicable surliness; and although at first
with a certain haughtiness she would take no notice of it, she now did her best to
win her affection, and on meeting her she had addressed her with all the charm of
her manner. But Frédérique’s answers were given in a curt, careless tone, and with
averted head; she suspected that Eline had remarked her coolness, but she was of too
frank a nature to be able to hide her feelings: she had no tact to feign what she
did not feel.
</p>
<p>The conversation turned on portraits, and Madame Verstraeten passed by Eline and Cateau
to take from a table an album which she wanted to show Madame van der Stoor and Madame
Eekhof.
</p>
<p>Musingly, and half listening to Toos, Eline thought of Fabrice, and saw the album
in Madame Verstraeten’s hands. And suddenly an idea rose to her mind, like a twig
of her vivid fantasy, with which her passion was overgrown. Yes; she would procure
an album for herself, with various portraits of him; it would be as a little shrine
of her love, in which she could worship the image of her god, unbeknown to any one
but herself. A secret joy stole over her features at that resolve, and at the thought
that she had so much to conceal from the eyes of others she began to consider herself
very important in her own eyes, and to feel herself more and more absorbed by the
treasures of her passion. She was happy, and her happiness was mingled with an arch
playfulness and secret exultation at the thought that she concealed within herself
something that her circle of friends would naturally have considered very foolish
and very reprehensible, had they known of it. A girl like her, to be in love with
an actor! What would Madame Verstraeten and Betsy and Emilie and Cateau and Frédérique,
Henk and Paul and Vincent, what would they all think and say could they suspect that?
</p>
<p>And with a half-mocking glance she looked round at her relatives and friends; she
thought herself plucky, secretly to defy the conventionalities to such an extent as
to dare to be smitten with <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>Fabrice! A jocular remark of Emilie’s made her laugh more immoderately than it called
for; at the same time she laughed at all who were there, in haughty arrogance at her
illicit passion.
</p>
<p>“And Mr. van Raat—Mr. Paul, I mean—will be a lawyer, I suppose?” asked Cateau.
</p>
<p>What a lot that child had to say about Paul! thought Eline. There was no end of Paul—Paul’s
nice voice, and Paul a lawyer——
</p>
<p>“I think you rather like Paul, don’t you?” asked Eline.
</p>
<p>“Oh, yes; I like him very much,” said Cateau, without hesitation. “Only sometimes,
you know, he gets so angry. Fancy, the other day—when we had the tableaux——”
</p>
<p>And Eline had to listen to the story of Paul’s anger when they had the tableaux, and
of Paul’s cleverness in the grouping.
</p>
<p>“She’s not afraid to speak her mind, at all events,” thought Eline; “but then, she
need not be exactly smitten, although she talks a great deal about him; if she were
she would probably do as I do, and—say nothing.”
</p>
<p>It was nearly half-past five; the guests were leaving.
</p>
<p>“Then I shall hear you sing together one day?” insisted Cateau.
</p>
<p>“Come round one Thursday afternoon; we always practise then.”
</p>
<p>“Oh! then I am in school.”
</p>
<p>“Well, one evening then, <i lang="fr">nous verrons</i>.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, with pleasure—Eline.”
</p>
<p>She pronounced that name for the first time since Eline’s request, and she let it
fall from her lips, much flattered at the familiarity. Then she took leave, urged
thereto by her mother.
</p>
<p>Eline stood still for a moment, by accident, beside Frédérique. She had already said
good-bye, and was waiting for Betsy, who <i lang="fr">en passant</i> was talking to Mr. Verstraeten, and she was on the point of saying something to Freddie.
But she waited, until Freddie spoke first—and both remained silent.
</p>
<p>On her way home, Cateau in ecstasy poured all kinds of nice things about Eline and
Paul into Madame van der Stoor’s ears.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>New Year’s Day had come and gone. On New Year’s Eve Betsy invited the Verstraetens
and Erlevoorts, as well as Madame Van Raat and Paul, to an oyster supper, and a happy
evening was spent in the warm comfort of her drawing-room. Now the winter days followed
each other in unbroken monotony, whilst the evenings glided on for Betsy and Eline
in one long string of <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>dinner-parties and soirées. The van Raats had a large circle of acquaintances, and
Betsy was famous for her choice little dinners, never with more than twelve persons
at the utmost, and always served with the most unstinted and refined luxury. They
lived in a coterie, the various members of which saw one another often and intimately,
and they were very pleased with the circle in which they moved.
</p>
<p>Eline, meanwhile, in the midst of that light glamour of worldliness continued to feed
the flame of her secret love in silent happiness, and thought it all very romantic.
One morning she had been shopping, and as she was returning along the Princessegracht,
she saw Fabrice slowly coming from the Bosch, close by the Bridge. She felt her heart
beating, and scarcely dared look up. Still, at last, with apparent indifference she
just ventured to glance at him. He wore a short frieze overcoat; a woollen muffler
was thrown carelessly about his throat, and he walked, his hands in his pockets, with
a somewhat surly expression on his dark face, shaded by the broad brim of his soft
felt hat. He gave her the impression of haughty reserve, and this made her idealize.
No doubt he was of a good family, for she thought there was something very <i lang="fr">distingué</i> in his powerful frame; his parents had been against his devoting himself to his art,
but he had felt a calling within him that was irresistible; he had received his musical
training at a conservatoire, and he had made his <i lang="fr">début</i>. And now a bitter disappointment filled his soul; he discovered that the surroundings
of actors in which he had to move was too rude and uncultured for him; he felt himself
different from them, and he withdrew himself within the coldness of his pride. He
thought of his youth, of his childhood, and again he saw his mother before him, entreating
him with clasped hands to bid farewell to his determination and think no more of the
stage.
</p>
<p>From that day Eline was seized with the caprice, as Betsy called it, to take long
walks in the morning. She thought the Bosch so beautiful in winter, she said; it was
grand to see those lofty upright stems, like pillars of marble, after the snow; it
was like a cathedral. Henk accompanied her once or twice with Leo and Faust, the two
boarhounds, but he preferred his usual morning ride, and she went alone, after she
had fetched the two dogs out of the stable. They sprang up at her with their big paws,
and like two rough pages waited near her protectingly in their wild playfulness.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was good for her health, she declared, when people spoke to her wonderingly about
those walks; she walked much too little, and feared she would be growing as stout
as Betsy, if she always rode. Doctor Reyer thought those morning promenades an excellent
idea.
</p>
<p>In the Bosch she met occasional promenaders, mostly the same people—an old gentleman
in a fur cloak, who was always coughing. But Fabrice she met but rarely. He was at
rehearsal probably, she thought, whenever she did not see the baritone, and then she
would return home in a disappointment that made her feel very fatigued, longing for
her boudoir, her cosy fire, her piano. But still she continued her walks, and made
the discovery that Fabrice took his constitutionals regularly on Fridays; other days
seemed to be very uncertain. She might and she might not see him. And in order to
meet him she did not mind rising early, sometimes still quite exhausted after a soirée
that had not been over till three o’clock; or tired out with dancing, and sleepy,
with blue circles under her weary eyes. ’Twas true she saw Fabrice very often now
at the opera, from a box, or the stalls, when she went with the Verstraetens, or with
Emilie de Woude and Georges; once she had invited the Ferelyns. But yet, now she saw
him quite differently, not separated from her by the footlights and the ideal conditions
of the stage; now she saw him right before her, not three paces removed from her,
like an ordinary person.
</p>
<p>On the days that she met Fabrice, the roomy vault of the besnowed trees seemed too
small to contain her happiness. She saw him approach with his manly, elastic step,
the hat slightly on one side, the muffler fluttering from his shoulder, and he passed
by, just glancing at her or the dogs, who sniffed at him, with careless eyes. When,
after that, she turned back and returned home along the Maliebaan, she was filled
with a joy that made her bosom heave, that brought a flush to her cold cheeks, and
made her forgetful of all fatigue; and on arriving home she would give vent to that
wealth of happiness with a jubilant outburst of song. The whole day she remained in
a bright, happy humour, and a charming vivacity took the place of her usual languid
grace. Her eyes sparkled, she joked and laughed continually, felt irritated at Henk’s
lazy good-nature and Ben’s sleepy quietness, and teased both father and son, making
the hall re-echo with her ringing laughter, and the stairs creak under her, as she
almost bounded down them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>One Friday morning, when she saw Fabrice approaching her, she formed a resolution.
She thought it very childish of her that she never had the courage to look him straight
in the face. He was an actor, after all, and no doubt he was used to being looked
at by ladies who met him in the street. He came nearer, and with something haughtily
audacious, and almost defiantly, she threw her little head backwards, and looked him
straight in the face. He returned that glance, as usual, with one of complete indifference,
and walked on. Then, in an excess of courage, she looked back. Would he? No, he walked
on, with his hands in his pockets, and she only saw his broad back gradually disappearing.
</p>
<p>That morning she hurried home, humming to herself between her closed lips, about which
there hovered an expression of roguish playfulness. She had no thought for anything
or any one but him, Fabrice, and she rang the bell at the Nassauplein. Grete answered
the door; Leo and Faust rushed inside. Oh, how she burst out laughing! she had forgotten
to take the dogs back to the stables. Loudly resounded their barking through the hall,
like a duo of basses.
</p>
<p>Out rushed Betsy from the dining-room, bursting with rage.
</p>
<p>“Heavens above, Eline, are you mad, bringing those wretched dogs in here? You know
I can’t bear them. I can’t understand what makes you do such a thing, if I don’t like
it! Or am I no longer mistress in my own house? Take them away, please, and at once.”
</p>
<p>Her voice sounded hard and rough, as one who is giving orders to an inferior.
</p>
<p>“They are thirsty, and I want to let them drink,” said Eline, with calm <i lang="fr">hauteur</i>.
</p>
<p>“And I <i>will not</i> have them drink here, I tell you! Look at that hall, look at the carpet, dirty marks
everywhere!”
</p>
<p>“Grete can clean all that in a minute.”
</p>
<p>“That isn’t your business! You lead the life of a princess here, and do nothing but
what displeases me. I tell you, take those dirty dogs away!”
</p>
<p>“First they must drink.”
</p>
<p>“Great heavens, I <i>will not have</i> them drink here,” cried Betsy, beside herself with passion.
</p>
<p>“They <i>shall</i> drink, in the garden,” answered Eline, quietly.
</p>
<p>“I should like to see that!” shrieked her sister. “If I——”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Leo, Faust,” cried Eline, still with an irritating composure, as she motioned the
dogs towards her.
</p>
<p>Betsy fumed with rage; her lips quivered, her hands shook, her breath seemed to choke
her. She could not say another word, she felt she could have struck Eline; but Eline,
followed by the leaping dogs, slowly went her way through the passage into the garden,
and filled a pail full of water at the tap. She thought it an exquisite delight to
enrage Betsy that day. The dogs drank their fill, and she led them back into the hall.
</p>
<p>Betsy still stood there, and her angry eyes flamed with rage at her own impotency.
She would have liked to run after Eline and snatch the pail out of her hands, but
her nerves were too excited.
</p>
<p>“I tell you, Eline, in the name of all that’s holy, that I shall tell Henk,” she began,
with a trembling voice, and a face flushed as red as fire.
</p>
<p>“Oh, rave as much as you like!” cried Eline, in a suddenly rising passion, and went
out of the house with the dogs, banging the door after her.
</p>
<p>In about a quarter of an hour she returned, singing, still full of happiness at meeting
Fabrice. She went up-stairs, and burst out in a brilliant shake, as if to tease Betsy,
who, nearly crying, was sitting in the dining-room.
</p>
<p>When Henk came home, Betsy told him the tale of Eline’s impudence in their own house;
but Henk grew impatient, would not come to any decision, and she reproached her husband
with his timidity, and a violent scene followed.
</p>
<p>For a whole week the sisters did not speak, to the despair of Henk, who found all
his domestic comfort spoilt by their sulking, especially at table, where the meals
were hurried through, although Eline kept up an incessant chatter with himself and
Ben.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It had struck Frédérique that last New Year’s Eve, at the van Raats’, Otto had chatted
and laughed a good deal with Eline; not remarkably so, but more than was his wont
generally with girls. For some days after that a question constantly rose to her lips
which she wanted to ask her brother, but no opportunity seemed to arrive for her to
put it. At times she was quite brusque towards Etienne, when he wanted to have a joke
with her, and Lili, Marie, and Paul had come to the conclusion that she had lost something
of her good temper; and she played but little with the children too.
</p>
<p>It was one of their evenings at home; only Etienne had gone out with some young friends
who had come to fetch him. The children were in bed, and Madame van Erlevoort sat
with Mathilde in the small drawing-room, the old lady with a book, Mathilde with some
needlework. Frédérique entered, smiled at her mother, and lovingly smoothed the gray
hair on her temples.
</p>
<p>“Freddie, will you just ring for Willem?” asked Mathilde. “Otto would like a cup of
tea in his room; he is busy writing.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, just pour him out a cup, I’ll take it him myself.”
</p>
<p>Mathilde poured out a cup, and Frédérique took it up-stairs. On the stairs she wondered
whether she would have the courage; perhaps Otto would say something himself; but
if he did not, she would venture.
</p>
<p>She entered Otto’s room. He was walking up and down dreamily, with his hands on his
back, quite contrary to his usual habits.
</p>
<p>“Hallo! there’s a nice little sis,” said he laughing, and took the cup from her hand.
“It will taste tenfold as nice from such pretty little fingers.”
</p>
<p>“But, Otto,” cried Frédérique, “how can you be so silly? I had expected a more original
kind of compliment, not such a stale platitude as that.”
</p>
<p>She continued to look at him smilingly, but did not catch his reply, as she was considering
to herself how to put her question. Perhaps he would not like it. Still she wanted
to have her say, and she tried to find something by way of introduction, some pretext
or another, to achieve her object; but in the frankness of <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>her nature she could find nothing, and so she simply commenced—
</p>
<p>“Otto, I—I have something to say to you, something to confess.”
</p>
<p>“A sin?”
</p>
<p>“A sin, no; hardly that I think—an—indiscretion I unwittingly committed towards you.
But you must forgive me beforehand.”
</p>
<p>“What! simply on your good faith?”
</p>
<p>“I tell you the indiscretion was committed involuntarily, and—I haven’t even been
as indiscreet as I should have liked to have been. I am therefore entitled to some
recompense; but I only ask you beforehand, whether I may depend upon your pardon?”
</p>
<p>“All right; I shall be merciful; say on then.”
</p>
<p>“You will really not be angry?”
</p>
<p>“No, no. What is it?”
</p>
<p>“Quite by accident—I discovered—you see—I know who, last St. Nicholas’ Eve——”
</p>
<p>He turned a little pale, whilst he stared at her, full of eager expectation. It did
not escape her with how much concentrated attention he was listening.
</p>
<p>“Gave—that fan—to Eline—that fan by Bucchi.”
</p>
<p>She remained standing right in front of him, something like a naughty child, quite
confused at her confession. He continued looking at her, a little frightened, with
big, staring eyes.
</p>
<p>“Do you know?” he commenced, stammering.
</p>
<p>“Now don’t be angry,” she resumed. “I really could not help it. I came into your room
one morning, I wanted a piece of sealing-wax, and—you have never forbidden me to come
into your room, have you?—I knocked, but you had gone out; and when I entered and
began to look for the sealing-wax, I saw in that pigeon-hole the leather case, which
I recognized at once in the evening. I thought at first it was something for me, and
wanted—wanted to open it; you know how inquisitive I am; but I did not do so, and
I was very sorry that I discovered your present. Tell me, now, are you angry? I couldn’t
really help it, could I now?”
</p>
<p>“Angry, my dear old girl! ’Tis nothing to be angry about at all,” he answered, with
forced lightness. “A surprise gift cannot last for ever; and besides—you haven’t told
Eline, of course, have you?”
</p>
<p>“Oh no; of course not.”
</p>
<p>“Well, what of it then? There’s no harm done,” he said <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>carelessly. “Or are you sorry that the fan was not intended for yourself?”
</p>
<p>She gave a contemptuous shrug. “I am surprised that you should think me so childish.
Only——”
</p>
<p>“Well, what?”
</p>
<p>She gave him a searching glance with those clear, true eyes, and he felt a little
abashed under that penetrating scrutiny.
</p>
<p>“Only—a young man—does not usually—make such presents—to a girl, if he is not very
fond of her.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, I like Eline very much; why should I not give her something for St. Nicholas?”
</p>
<p>“No, Otto, you are not frank with me,” she said impatiently, and drew him with her
on the sofa. “Come, sit down, and just listen to me. A sensible fellow like yourself
doesn’t give a fan, of I don’t know how much value, to a girl, if—if he is not in
love with her. <i>That</i> you need not try to make me believe; you never gave Eline anything before, neither
did you give Lili or Marie anything this time. So, you see, I am not so blind; I can
see well enough that there’s more in it,” she continued, and laid her hands on his
shoulders. But all at once she stopped. “Oh, perhaps you think—perhaps you don’t want
me to speak to you about it,” she stammered, almost frightened.
</p>
<p>“Freddie, on the contrary,” he said softly, and drew her closer towards him, “I am
very glad to speak to you about—about Eline. Why not? But suppose, now, that I really
cared much, very much for Eline, would you think it so unwise in me?” he asked smilingly.
</p>
<p>“Oh, Eline is no girl for you!” she suddenly burst out in passionate fervour. “No,
Otto, no; Eline is not the kind of girl for you. She is very pretty, I know, and there
is something about her—something very attractive—but to me she is—antipathetic, I
assure you. Believe me, you must really not think any more of her, you would never
be happy with her; you are so affectionate and good. If you really were to begin caring
for her very much, you would perhaps devote your whole soul to her, you would want
to live only for her, and she could not return you one-tenth of what you gave her.
She has no heart, she is cold as ice, and full of egotism—nothing but egotism.”
</p>
<p>“But, Freddie, Freddie,” he interrupted, “my dear girl, how you rush on! Where have
you obtained all your experience of human <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>nature, that you can give me such a precise description of Eline’s character?”
</p>
<p>It irritated her to hear how softly, almost caressingly, he pronounced her name.
</p>
<p>“Knowledge of human nature? I know nothing about that. I only know what I feel, and
that is, that Eline lives but for herself, and is incapable of making the slightest
sacrifice for another. I feel—nay, I declare, I am convinced of it—that if you married
Eline, you would never, never be happy. She might like you for a time, but her love
would only be egotism, as everything in her is egotism.”
</p>
<p>“Freddie, you are severe,” he said, softly but reproachfully. “’Tis very nice of you
to feel so much for me, but you are very, very hard on Eline. I don’t think you know
her, and, on the contrary, I believe that she would sacrifice herself altogether for
one she loved.”
</p>
<p>“You say I don’t know her; but how can you know her then? You only see her when she
is all smiles and amiability.”
</p>
<p>“Do you think it a fault in her, that she prefers to be amiable rather than discourteous?”
</p>
<p>Frédérique gave a sigh. “Oh, Otto, I—I don’t know <i>what</i> I think; I only feel that you cannot be happy with her,” she said, in a tone of conviction.
</p>
<p>He took her hand and smiled. “Why, you speak as though we were going to be married
to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, do—do tell me—don’t think me—inquisitive. You haven’t—proposed to her, have you?”
</p>
<p>He looked at her, still smiling, and slowly shook his head.
</p>
<p>“Then promise me, will you, that you will take time to think over it?—don’t be——”
She clung to him affectionately, and her eyes filled with tears.
</p>
<p>“You are a dear girl, Freddie, but really——”
</p>
<p>“You think it absurd of me, perhaps, to venture to advise you?”
</p>
<p>“Not at all. On the contrary, I am most sincerely grateful to you for it; but still,
you must not allow yourself to be guided by a mere idea, or rather an antipathy, for
which there is not even a reason, and to judge another person so harshly. Accept and
follow that advice, then I shall not think you absurd, but a dear, dear little sis.”
</p>
<p>He kissed her repeatedly, and she rested her head shyly on his shoulder.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>“You won’t be angry with me, will you now? Perhaps I have been clumsy; I should not
have spoken like that.”
</p>
<p>“To me you are most dear when you are most outspoken to me, and I hope you will always
be so.”
</p>
<p>“Then perhaps I shall be <i>discourteous</i> and <i>unamiable</i>,” she answered with emphasis.
</p>
<p>“And now you are just a little spiteful. What is it? Are you jealous of Eline?”
</p>
<p>“Yes,” she answered curtly.
</p>
<p>“Because of the fan, I suppose,” he laughed.
</p>
<p>“Oh, you do tease me,” she pouted. “No; not because of the fan, I have a dozen of
them, but because—because you care for her.”
</p>
<p>“Let us make a compact together then. You go and find me a nice girl whom you consider
fit to be my wife, and of whom you are not jealous; then when you have found her,
and I like her, I shall think no more of Eline. What do you say to that?”
</p>
<p>She answered nothing, but rose, and wiped away her tears. His badinage displeased
her, and made her fear that he thought her foolish. She approached the table, pointed
to the cup of tea, and said—
</p>
<p>“Your tea is getting cold, Otto; why don’t you drink it?”
</p>
<p>Ere he could reply, she had gone, full of conflicting thoughts, pleased that she had
given vent to her feelings, and had obtained Otto’s confidence; and yet uncertain
whether she would not have done better to have said nothing.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>For five days Eline had not met Fabrice on her early walks, and the disappointment
of the mornings spoilt the whole of the days that followed. At first she grew quiet,
morose, and irritable; very soon she became more melancholy, she sang no more, she
refused to see Roberts, her master, or to accompany Paul van Raat in his duets. One
morning, after her walk, about half-past ten, she returned home, and threw herself
musingly on her sofa, while, with wandering fingers, she unclasped her cloak. She
could not bear Ben near her, and sent him away to the nursemaid; and thoroughly tired
out, with her big, hazel eyes moist and glistening with unsatisfied longing, she let
her glance wander along the palms, the pictures, the group by Canova. A melancholy
oppressiveness fell upon her like a cloud, and she asked herself the <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>question, Why must she live, if she were not to be happy? To give her sorrow a definite
shape, she searched about for grievances, and made the most of them; she was in need
of affection, and there was no one to love her. With Betsy she could get on no longer,
as it seemed; she was continually at variance with her sister, and it was not always
her fault; Frédérique was conspicuously cool towards her, for what reason she had
not the remotest idea. It was only old Madame van Raat who continued affectionate
as ever; but just at present she felt but little in the humour to display that amiable
frankness, tempered with a flavour of veneration, which had won the old lady’s heart.
Yes; her life was a useless existence, she was continually swinging from one day to
another, without any object, and she longed for—for something like the vague vision,
without definite shape, which seemed to rise as in a sphere of love, sometimes purely
ideal, like an idyll, sometimes simpler in form and suffused with a halo of homeliness
and domestic happiness.
</p>
<p>She sighed as she raised her hand towards the azalea, and crumpled the leaves between
her nervous fingers. With an effort she compelled her musings to assume some definite
form before her mental vision, and by a sudden caprice of her fantasy, she saw herself
together with Fabrice, and both of them were singing at the opera in some great city.
They loved one another, and they were famous; they were overwhelmed with wreaths and
bouquets, and the whole vision rose before her vivid and entrancing, as it had done
one day whilst she was singing with Paul.
</p>
<p>But her imagination not receiving any fresh fuel, not having seen Fabrice for so long,
lost its vivid colouring; her vision faded, and left her in a gray, sombre mood—a
seeming reflex of the sky outside, which was heavy with dark rain-clouds. She felt
the hot tears glide along her lashes; she had a great longing for Henk, to whom she
was anxious to confide her sorrow, he was so fond of her, and knew how to administer
such comforting words to her in his own kindly, clumsy way; the mere sound of his
voice alone, so kindly, so genial, and heavy, fell like a healing balm upon her soul.
</p>
<p>And so she sat sobbing, and thought how disagreeable all that sulking with Betsy was.
To-morrow it would be her, Eline’s, birthday. Would Betsy take the first step towards
a reconciliation, or did the cause of the quarrel really rest with herself? Had she
<span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>felt sure of her reception by her sister, she would gladly have ventured a <i>rapprochement</i>, or even have apologized, if necessary; but she feared Betsy’s coolness. So she would
wait; yes, she would wait.
</p>
<p>The afternoon passed slowly, the hours dragged themselves along, as though weary under
the burden of her melancholy. Then she dressed for a dinner-party at the Hydrechts’,
without the slightest expectation of finding any amusement there. She would gladly
have asked Betsy to say that she was ill at home; but it would not do. Unlike the
Verstraetens recently, the Hydrechts might take offence, and besides, Betsy might
perhaps refuse to do as she asked. So she went, and screwed herself up to a coquettish
gaiety which, with her natural tact in hiding her feelings, effectually blinded the
eyes of all.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The next day was the twentieth of January, her birthday. She stayed late in bed, surrounded
by the warmth of the blankets, in the soft red light reflected by the curtains, without
any desire to rise, or any longing for her morning walk. She would not see him if
she went, her presentiment told her. She began to feel childishly superstitious. It
was now close upon nine. If Mina should come in before the clock struck nine, to arrange
her washstand for her, she would meet Fabrice in the Bosch to-morrow. But Mina came
after nine, and when the girl had put everything straight and had left the room, she
thought of something fresh. If last evening she had laid her bracelet in the large
vase she would meet Fabrice; <i>not</i>, if she had placed it in the small one; and she raised herself up, drew the red damask
bed-curtains aside, and glanced round. There lay the bracelet in the large vase. With
a smile, she once more lay back in the pillows.
</p>
<p>She struggled with herself to get up, but why not stay in bed in the cosy warmth?
She was weary with grief, why commence another day? Ere long her friends would come
to congratulate her; she would have to be nice and amiable, and receive their presents
with delighted ecstasy, and she was in a far from amiable humour; she felt no desire
to see any one.
</p>
<p>It struck half-past ten, and she thought perhaps Betsy would soon be coming in, and
in a few friendly words make up the quarrel; she listened for her sister’s step on
the stairs, but her expectations were in vain, and at last, unnerved by her languor,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>she rose, and lazily proceeded to dress. The glass reflected her image with something
of sadness in the eyes and a weary expression about the mouth, and to herself she
seemed quite ugly. But what did it matter after all? for whose sake should she be
pretty? There was no one who loved her with such fervour as she thought that her heart
was capable of.
</p>
<p>She was dressed, and all at once a shivering overtook her. She did not feel equal
to going down-stairs; how should she approach Betsy? Should she take up an attitude
of expectation merely? Why did not Betsy meet her half-way? Why must she continue
bearing a grudge like that, about such a trifling matter? Eline felt almost afraid
to see Betsy in the breakfast-room, and she walked into her boudoir, where the fire
was already burning brightly, and threw herself on her sofa, wretched and weary with
grief and loneliness. Why, yes, why did she live?
</p>
<p>Deeper and deeper she sank into the abyss of melancholy, when at last some glimmer
of light came to pierce the gloom that enshrouded her, for she heard Henk and Ben
coming up the stairs. They came nearer; she heard their voices; there was a noisy
knocking at her door.
</p>
<p>“Where are you, old girl; still in bed?” cried Henk.
</p>
<p>“No; I am here, in my boudoir,” she answered, slightly raising her voice.
</p>
<p>The door was opened and Henk appeared, shaking his head, while Ben slipped through
between his father’s high riding-boots, a bouquet clasped in his little fists.
</p>
<p>“Auntie, many happy returns of your birthday—and this is from Ben,” said the child,
as though he were repeating a lesson learnt by heart, while he laid the bouquet in
her lap.
</p>
<p>“But, my dear girl, what a time you are up-stairs this morning! you are generally
back from your walk by now,” cried Henk.
</p>
<p>She did not answer, but embraced the child, and her eyes grew moist as she did so.
</p>
<p>“Put—put it in water, Ben, will you? in some tepid water. There, in the vase, carefully.”
</p>
<p>Ben, always obedient and docile, did as he was told. Eline fell back again in the
pillows, and looked at her brother-in-law with a faint smile.
</p>
<p>“I feel so wretched to-day—not well at all,” she said languidly.
</p>
<p>Henk approached nearer, with his hands on his back.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>“What, on your birthday too?” he asked cheerily. “Come, I would make haste and get
down-stairs if I were you, you lazy girl; but let me give you a good kiss first—a
real good one, do you hear?” and he pressed his lips on both her checks, while she
lay still and smiled.
</p>
<p>“And here is a trifle for you, Elly—I hope you will like it,” he continued, as he
handed her a small case.
</p>
<p>She laughed a little.
</p>
<p>“How droll of you to come and bring me my present here! Thank you, Henk, thanks very
much.”
</p>
<p>She opened the case; in it there was a hairpin in the shape of a diamond spider.
</p>
<p>“But, Henk,” she cried, “how you spoil me! I remember, when I saw it at van Kempen’s
a little while ago, I said I thought it very pretty. I really must be careful what
I say in future,” she said, almost shyly, and she thought of the Bucchi fan.
</p>
<p>“Betsy kept her ears open when she heard you speak about the pin,” he answered. “We
are always glad to give you something that will please you.”
</p>
<p>This almost aggravated her, but she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him.
</p>
<p>“Really, really, you are spoiling me,” she stammered.
</p>
<p>“Come, come, that’s all rubbish!” he exclaimed. “But now I must be off for a little
ride; so make haste down-stairs, old girl, or I shall carry you down.”
</p>
<p>“No, no, that you won’t!”
</p>
<p>“All right then; but hurry up.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, in a moment; but no nonsense, Henk, do you hear?” she cried, frightened,
and in a serious, commanding tone, for she could foresee an attack of practical joking,
and she certainly felt in no humour to tolerate it.
</p>
<p>He laughingly re-assured her. The words were on his lips to urge her to a reconciliation
with his wife, but he feared he had not the tact to approach the subject with sufficient
caution. She might fly up in a passion, and besides—it would all come right soon,
he thought, and left the room.
</p>
<p>She rose, and lingering over her toilet, suspected that Betsy must have told Henk
to take the present up-stairs, so as not to have to hand it her herself. She felt
embarrassed at her own attitude; now she was compelled to take the first step towards
a <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>reconciliation, and this wounded her pride. It would seem as though she were so delighted
with their present, that it made up for all past unpleasantness. ’Twas most tiresome,
but still she could not now come down-stairs, and, after a hasty, cool greeting, commence
her breakfast without saying a word. She felt very sorry that she had not followed
her impulse of the previous day to try a <i>rapprochement</i>. After all it was really too stupid, that sulking, and only because of those dogs!
And she held the diamond spider coquettishly against her hair and her throat.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Before she came down-stairs, Eline opened a drawer of her writing-desk. With a furtive
smile she took from it an album, a present to herself, and opened it. It contained
nothing but portraits of Fabrice, in various positions and dresses, and which for
some time past she had been purchasing with much tact, but still not without nervousness;
now in one shop, then in another, never returning to the same, constantly fearing
that the shopkeeper would guess something of her secret. On one occasion she had been
in Amsterdam for a day to visit some friends; there she was very daring, and in a
bookshop had bought seven all at once; no one knew her there, and she vowed to herself
that she would never again set foot in the shop.
</p>
<p>With her eyes sparkling with wanton playfulness she glanced through her collection,
and whatever page she turned his dark black-bearded face met her eyes now and again
as she had met him in the Bosch with his big felt and his muffler. Ah! she knew it
now; it was tenderer feeling than admiration that vibrated through her at the sight,
which, in her womanly sense of honour and in shame at herself, made her shudder as
for a moment she pressed her lips on that beloved image. Yes, she felt it now; it
was a passion that filled her being as with a wealth of rapture; a love for which
she could sacrifice all and anything that he might demand of her.
</p>
<p>And her imagination, a little relieved of its burden of melancholy by Henk’s cheery
words, in which she sometimes heard the echo of long-vanished wishes, grew heated
with romantic ideas. In her flight with Fabrice, she saw herself at a railway station
awaiting the train, and fearing lest they would be overtaken.
</p>
<p>“Auntie, auntie, let me in!” cried Ben, outside the door.
</p>
<p>She put the album away and opened the door. Ben came in, <span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>cautiously clasping the vase full of water in both his little hands.
</p>
<p>“Carefully, little man,” said Eline. “Sure you haven’t spilt any on the stairs?”
</p>
<p>He shook his head, pleased with himself at his smartness. Whilst he placed the bouquet
in the vase, Eline reflected that the little fellow’s present was only another attention
on Betsy’s part. It was a great bother after all.
</p>
<p>But at last she summed up courage and proceeded down-stairs with Ben. Betsy was in
the dining-room, and in consultation with Grete.
</p>
<p>“Good morning, Betsy,” said Eline.
</p>
<p>“Good morning, Elly. Many happy returns!” answered Betsy, without any expression.
</p>
<p>Eline would not say more; first the servant must leave the room. Breakfast she did
not want; she had no appetite.
</p>
<p>“Grete, you can clear away, I don’t want anything,” she said, and began playing with
Ben to do something.
</p>
<p>Betsy remained seated in front of her writing-desk, absorbed in bills and books, like
a careful housewife. And after a few seconds’ painful silence, Betsy having peevishly
told Ben not to worry, and sent him away to the nursery, Eline rose. She walked across
the room to her sister, and laid her hand on her shoulder.
</p>
<p>“Betsy,” she commenced. But she could not yet bring herself to say anything about
the present, the diamond spider. “Betsy, come, would it not be better if—? You don’t
know how sorry I am that we are so. Come, now, don’t be angry with me, it was wrong
of me.”
</p>
<p>“Well, Eline, I am glad you admit it. I am not angry.”
</p>
<p>“Is it all forgotten then?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, certainly. You know there’s nothing I dislike more than unpleasantness, so let
us say no more about it.”
</p>
<p>Her cool tone was as so much ice to Eline, but still she bent down and gave Betsy
a kiss.
</p>
<p>“No, really, I am sorry; of course I have no right in your own house—it pains me very
much.”
</p>
<p>She wanted to say something more, but could find no words, and once more her lips
sought Betsy’s forehead. She, however, pushed her lightly aside.
</p>
<p>“All right; let us say no more about it then. I am no more angry. But not so much
kissing, you know I don’t care about it.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>Her birthday passed by gloomily enough for Eline. The reconciliation with Betsy had
not made the desired impression on her; she had pictured something much more cordial—a
sisterly embrace, an intermingling of tears—the prelude to future affectionate intercourse
with each other. But what had been the reality? On Betsy’s part an icy condescension,
by the side of which she, in her attitude, had cut a somewhat sorry figure. She knew
herself to be weaker than her sister, and yet she would resist her over-ruling; but
with every attempt at opposition, and especially after this latest one, followed as
it was by a temporary, hollow victory, she felt herself more and more powerless to
continue the struggle with such unequal moral weapons. Her pride had only proved a
frail reed, breaking with every gust of wind, and in her dismay a hopeless gloom seemed
to enshroud her thoughts as with a thick veil of crape.
</p>
<p>For all that she kept up a semblance of gaiety that afternoon in the midst of the
cheery company of the friends who came to congratulate her. But Madame van Raat, from
whose dreamy, light-blue eyes she would have been so glad to have seen a ray of sympathy
beam upon her, was indisposed, and sent an apology through Paul, and this was a great
disappointment to her. Madame van Erlevoort and Mathilde came to add the excuses of
Freddie, who was at home with a cold, and again Eline wondered why Frédérique should
be so reserved towards her. Jeanne Ferelyn overwhelmed her with a string of domestic
troubles, and it required all her tact and amiability not to display any undue impatience
in listening to them. Little Cateau van der Stoor, who, like Madame van Raat, she
would have been glad to see, appeared to have forgotten her birthday; she neither
saw nor heard anything of her. But Emilie de Woude brought her own boisterous gaiety
with her. Her lively chat infused a little brightness into the dull atmosphere of
the drawing-room—in which the gas was not yet lit—into which, along the heavy folds
of the draperies, a darkening twilight penetrated which seemed to transform the brightness
of the gilded panelling, and the glistening sheen of the fawn-satin cushions, into
undefined and gloomy shadows. Emilie wanted to see Eline’s presents, charming trifles—a
few bouquets arranged on a table, round about a big basket full of flowers and fruit.
</p>
<p>“What a splendid <i>corbeille</i>!” cried Emilie. “Peaches, grapes, roses—lovely! From whom, Elly?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>“From Vincent; pretty, is it not?”
</p>
<p>“I wish I had such nice cousins.”
</p>
<p>“Hush!” whispered Eline.
</p>
<p>Vincent had just entered the room, and his eyes went in search of the hostess. Betsy
received him, as usual, with a certain warmth and geniality in her constant, vague
fear of what that cousin <i>might</i> do. Eline thanked him, and clasped both his hands in hers.
</p>
<p>Vincent apologized for coming so late; it was a quarter past five, and the Verstraetens
and the others were taking their leave in the gathering twilight, after which Gerard
came in to light the gas, close the blinds, and draw the curtains.
</p>
<p>“Vincent, stay to dinner, will you?” asked Betsy. For Betsy was in terror at having
to face a dull evening. They were not invited out anywhere, and besides, she had not
thought it the thing to make any arrangements to go out on her sister’s birthday;
neither could she have done so, as during their late feud she had scarcely uttered
a word to her. With Vincent she need stand on no ceremony, she could very well ask
him half an hour before dinner. Vincent had conversation when he was in a good humour,
and, at all events, he brought a fresh face with him to the table.
</p>
<p>Vincent accepted the invitation with an indifferent “with pleasure.” In the meantime
Henk declared he wanted a walk, and taking his hat quickly left the house, his coat-collar
turned up, and his hands in his pockets. Anne, the nursemaid, came to fetch Ben, to
make him a little tidy, as his face was besmeared with jam from the pastry he had
been eating. Betsy disappeared too, and Eline and Vincent were left alone in the drawing-room,
now bright with gas-light.
</p>
<p>“Come, let us sit down in the boudoir,” said Eline, and Vincent followed her to the
little room. The soft, clear beams from the small crystal chandelier, reflected on
the violet plush of the furniture, lent the place an air of something mysteriously
intimate, something that seemed to tempt to an unreserved confidence. To Vincent,
however, it appeared to convey no sense other than one of a calm well-being; with
a sigh he let himself fall on the couch with his usual languor, and put Eline a number
of indifferent questions about the acquaintances he had just now seen taking their
leave. Whilst answering him, she felt a great sympathy for her cousin arise within
her. Again it was that need within her that had aroused such a passion for Fabrice,
the need she felt of much <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>love and tenderness, the longing to expend the pent-up treasures of her affection.
And just as it had struck Paul by the wan reflection of a petroleum-lamp, so it now
struck her under the bright gas-light that played and sparkled in a thousand colours
through the drooping pendants. Vincent’s resemblance to her dear dead father was so
striking that, looking at him, she almost fancied herself once more back in her childhood.
Yes, just like that, with that pained expression about the mouth, with those eyes
full of sadness, her father used to lie down, exhausted by his artistic visions; just
like that his hand used to hang over the arm of his chair when the brush had fallen
from his grasp.
</p>
<p>And Eline’s sympathy for Vincent grew stronger, permeated with compassion and poetic
melancholy, as she sat listening to his low, wan, murmuring voice, while he spoke
to her about Smyrna; he seemed more interesting than most of the young men in their
coterie. To her he became a martyr to the littleness of the world, when he told her
that to him the Hague was <i lang="de">kleinstättig</i> and tiresome, and that he longed for much space and freedom. So did she.
</p>
<p>“But I weary you with my complaints, <i lang="fr">parlons autre chose</i>,” he interrupted himself in an altered tone. “It isn’t polite of me to talk so much
about myself.”
</p>
<p>“Oh no, not at all; you don’t weary me in the least,” she answered somewhat hurriedly,
rather upset that he had cut the thread of her fantasy so abruptly. “Don’t you think
that I can quite share your thoughts, that I don’t understand how you can wish for
anything else than the prosy groove in which we continue to go round and round? Sometimes
I, too, would gladly escape from it,” she cried, with a movement of her arms like
that of a captive bird beating his wings against his cage. “Sometimes I feel myself
moved to some terribly mad freak or another,” and she smiled slyly as she thought
of Fabrice.
</p>
<p>He, also smiling, shook his head, and just touched her uplifted hand, as it fell gracefully
by her side.
</p>
<p>“And why should you wish to commit follies now?” he asked. “You go to extremes. To
live independently of anyone, not to trouble yourself about the small-talk of a coterie,
but to follow your own ideas as long as they are sensible, to change your surroundings
as often as you like—that is my ideal. There’s nothing preserves one’s youth so much
as change.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span></p>
<p>“But in order to be independent, to trouble oneself about nothing—one must possess
more moral strength than we in our superculture usually dare show,” she answered.
</p>
<p>“Moral strength! Oh dear, no; you only want the money, that’s all,” he replied briefly.
“If I am rich, have good manners, commit no follies, but manage to keep myself nice
and agreeable in the eyes of the world, it is quite in my power to see my ideal realized,
without any one accusing me of anything more than perhaps—a little eccentricity.”
</p>
<p>All this was much too sober to her way of thinking, and she urged forward her own
ideas, which seemed to her more romantic.
</p>
<p>“Yes, all right, money, of course,” she resumed, avoiding his argument with true feminine
weakness; “but without sufficient strength to force through one’s own will, one would
soon be carried away by all the old habits. You see, that is why”—he laughed at her
charming want of logic—“that is why I should so much like to do something—foolish—something
terribly foolish. I feel myself strong enough to go my own way in spite of the world.
I sometimes feel very desperate indeed.”
</p>
<p>He enjoyed the fire and animation that beamed from her glistening eyes, and her whole
elegant little figure, as she sat there in her giddy coquettishness, gave him the
impression of a butterfly just about to flutter away.
</p>
<p>“But, Eline!” he cried laughing. “What is it you are taking into your head now? What
is it you would like to do then, what sort of follies? Come, just confess, you naughty
child.”
</p>
<p>She laughed too.
</p>
<p>“Oh, say elope!”
</p>
<p>“With me?”
</p>
<p>“Why not? But I think you would soon leave me to my fate. I should be rather too expensive
a luxury to you, and you would send me back with many thanks. <i lang="fr">Merci bien</i> then, if your question was intended for an invitation; I would rather wait for a
wealthy milord.”
</p>
<p>“No love in a cottage then?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, Vincent, how stale! <i lang="fr">Jamais!</i> I should die of <i>ennui</i>. I had rather be an actress, and run away with an actor.”
</p>
<p>And she was all a-sparkle with sheer wantonness of exuberance; she felt a secret enjoyment
at the thought of Fabrice, and looked Vincent boldly in the eyes; he could not guess
her thoughts.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>He burst out in laughter; the lively playfulness which had taken the place of her
languid grace during their conversation, the brightness in her eyes, and the tapping
of her little hand on her knee, amused him even more than her words, and yet they
were sympathetic enough with his own ideas; in them there lurked a longing for change,
which was very much like his own. They looked at one another smilingly, and under
the soft but concentrated glance of his eyes, Eline felt something of the slow, ensnaring
fascination of that of a serpent.
</p>
<p>“What a striking resemblance to my dear papa,” she thought, almost surprised at the
sympathy she felt for Vincent, as they rose at the sound of the dinner-bell.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Madame Verstraeten was at home with Lili, who had caught a severe cold, while Marie
and Frédérique, skates in hand, accompanied Paul and Etienne to the Ysclub, round
by the Laan van Meerdervoort. The old gentleman sat reading in the warm conservatory,
in the midst of the glossy green foliage of the azaleas and the palms. Lili was not
in her usual good humour; she answered her mother in languid monosyllables, and nearly
suffocated herself, trying to repress her coughing. For she was better, she had declared,
and coughed no more; it would do her no good to stay at home any longer, and she would
go out in a day or two.
</p>
<p>And yet, notwithstanding that determination, out yonder it seemed to her like Siberia,
when she saw the frozen snow lying hard and white on the bare branches and on the
unsoiled marble-like paths. Madame Verstraeten continued her crochet work, and the
deft movements of the crochet needle irritated Lili, just as the regular turning of
the pages of her father’s book irritated her. She herself did nothing, and her hands
lay wearily in her lap, but however much she enjoyed such a <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i> at other times, now it wearied her terribly, and yet she felt no desire for any occupation.
Secretly she envied Freddie and Marie’s good health and spirits, while she was delicate
and was obliged to guard <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>against the slightest draught. But when her sister hesitated to accompany Freddie
and Etienne, she herself had induced her to go and fetch her skates; Marie could not
always stay at home with her if she were foolish enough to be ill, and besides, mamma
would keep her company.
</p>
<p>A sigh escaped her lips as she took a lozenge from the little box before her, and
the old lady looked at her furtively, well knowing that in her present excitable mood
any show of motherly anxiety on her part would irritate Lili more than the utmost
indifference.
</p>
<p>So the afternoon slowly passed under Lili’s quiet pouting, and no one came to disturb
the dull peacefulness that prevailed until past four, when the bell rang and Dien
showed Georges de Woude inside. Lili felt annoyed; Dien might have announced him first,
she thought. Surely he was not so intimate with them as all that! And while Madame
Verstraeten gave him her hand, she greeted him somewhat coolly, slowly reaching her
little white fingers towards him—slowly too, following, when her mother conducted
him to the conservatory, to the old gentleman. Her parents were already sitting down
with him, when she languidly pushed up a cane-chair, and as languidly sat down in
it, as though to show him that his visit disturbed her, and that she joined them merely
for courtesy’s sake.
</p>
<p>At the first few words he addressed to her parents she looked away with somewhat affected
absent-mindedness into the garden, as though she took no interest in their conversation.
Madame Verstraeten had commenced with a question about Berlin, where he had been attached
to the Legation for three months, but he replied rather briefly; half addressing himself
to Lili, and by turns looking at her and her mother, he inquired after her health;
had she really been seriously ill? Lili muttered something, whilst her mother replied;
but it struck her that he asked the question with a certain anxiety, not as a mere
commonplace, as if indeed he felt an interest in her welfare. What could it matter
to him whether she was ill or not? But he did not seem to remark her coolness, when,
seeing the subject was not attractive to her, he again turned his easy flowing conversation
to Berlin, and in his agreeable manner replied to her parents’ questions. Each time
he looked at her, as if to draw her into the conversation, and out of courtesy she
now and again smiled a little, and asked some trifling question, as indifferently
as possible.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>How he rattled on, she thought, as she had thought before, when he once began to talk;
but still, it was as though that thought was rather a forced one, and not entirely
spontaneous. He rattled, it was true; but there was something pleasant and sociable
in his chat—something that, whether she admitted it or not, entertained her after
the tiresome afternoon she had spent by the side of her knitting mother. He did not
talk badly, a little excited, but tiresome he was not, and—it seemed as though she
had never before remarked it—he was not so terribly affected after all. His accent
was perhaps a little too studied, but that was all; his gestures were simple, and
through his easy manner there shone an evident sincerity whenever he turned to her.
And his dress, it was faultlessly neat, perhaps too much so; still it was not that
of a coxcomb, she must admit it was simple enough.
</p>
<p>He chatted on as Mr. Verstraeten asked him about his engagements, and whilst she looked
at him, she unconsciously smiled at him with more cordiality. It did not escape him,
and once more he ventured to ask her, did she feel better now, did she not go out
yet? What could it matter to him? again she thought, almost annoyed; he had asked
her once out of politeness, that was more than sufficient, but still she answered
him, and told him her cough was better—a little cough quickly belied her words—and
that she was feeling much easier under the kindly care of mamma and Marie. He felt
grateful for those words, but he had heard the suppressed cough, and it was on his
lips to caution her to be careful—the weather was so bleak—but he did not do so; she
might think it was no business of his, and he asked after Marie.
</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” answered Lili; “she has gone skating with Frédérique and Etienne van Erlevoort
and with Paul. Don’t you pity me that I have to stay at home again, like the sick
child?”
</p>
<p>“Are you so very sorry that you could not go? Are you fond of skating?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; that is to say, I like it very much; but speaking frankly, I don’t know much
about it. Marie and Freddie skate much better than I; they go curling and twisting
about while I can only just amble along; I am too frightened, you know, and——”
</p>
<p>“But do not Paul or Etienne assist you then?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, Paul says frankly that he thinks it tiresome to skate with such a duffer, and
Etienne—yes, I must admit—he will sacrifice himself for five minutes sometimes.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>“But, Lili,” said Madame Verstraeten, “if you cannot skate, it is certainly tiresome
to them.”
</p>
<p>“I was more polite in my time,” said the old gentleman.
</p>
<p>“Oh, I make them no reproaches,” said Lili; “I am only telling you the facts,” and
she gave a little cough.
</p>
<p>“But, when you are better, when you are going out again,” resumed Georges hesitating—he
knew he was making a bold plunge—“may I now and then offer you my assistance? I am
mostly at my office, ’tis true, but still——”
</p>
<p>“You skate, then?” cried Lili. She would never have thought it of him.
</p>
<p>“I am passionately fond of it!” he declared. “Do you accept?”
</p>
<p>She nearly blushed, and answered, smiling, with downcast eyes—
</p>
<p>“Oh, with pleasure, yes. But you will have such a trouble with me. I am so frightened;
I always fancy I hear the ice crack, you see—you don’t know what you are offering
me.”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” he answered; “I don’t think I shall ever regret having asked you.”
</p>
<p>How was it, thought Lili, that he could repeat a sentence like that, with such an
expression of sincerity, and she could find no reply? She only laughed a little. There
was a pause in the conversation, but Georges quickly revived it, and continued his
pleasant chat until it grew dark, when he rose, apologizing for his lengthy visit.
</p>
<p>“Oh, not at all; on the contrary,” said Mr. Verstraeten, “I am very pleased to see
you again. Remember me to the old gentleman and to your sister.”
</p>
<p>“Emilie declared she could not manage without you,” added Madame Verstraeten. “She
will be glad you are home again.”
</p>
<p>Lili thought she could understand that Emilie must have missed Georges, and she offered
him her hand, and once more cordially thanked him for his offer.
</p>
<p>“A good fellow, that de Woude!” said Mr. Verstraeten, when he had gone, and Lili returned
to the small drawing-room, and as she went heard mamma also express herself favourably
about Georges, charmed as she was with his polished courteousness.
</p>
<p>“He always gives us a call when he can. Of course he would not do so if there were
no girls in the house, if we received no company, but still——”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lili heard no more; she smiled at her own fancies, in which she saw herself together
with Georges, gliding over the ice, their hands clasped in each other’s.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Marie came home, accompanied by Freddie, Paul, and Etienne, who took leave at the
door; she entered the room tired out, cold, with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes.
It had been splendid; the ice was crowded, the little Eekhofs, Eline, and Henk were
there.
</p>
<p>“De Woude has called here,” said Madame Verstraeten. “He has been back these three
days.”
</p>
<p>“Indeed!” said Marie with indifference, and she began to unclasp her little cloak.
</p>
<p>“And he asked me to go skating with him, when I am better,” said Lili, somewhat embarrassed,
and with a little cough.
</p>
<p>Marie all at once stopped undoing her cloak, and looked at her sister in astonishment.
</p>
<p>“De Woude? With you? And what did you say?”
</p>
<p>“That I thought it very nice of him, of course. What else should I have said?”
</p>
<p>Marie roared with laughter.
</p>
<p>“What, you skating with de Woude? with that ‘stuck-up coxcomb,’ that ‘piece of affectation’?
But, Lili, that will never do; you always thought him such an intolerable bore.”
</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Qu’est ce que ça fait?</i> At least he is politer than Paul or Etienne, and if he likes to assist me——”
</p>
<p>Marie still laughed.
</p>
<p>“But he can’t skate!” she cried contemptuously.
</p>
<p>“He says he is passionately fond of it.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t you believe it. Rubbish!”
</p>
<p>Lili shrugged her shoulders impatiently.
</p>
<p>“But he wouldn’t tell any fibs about it, surely!”
</p>
<p>“Dear me, how eager you are all of a sudden to champion him! At one time there was
no good in him at all.”
</p>
<p>“I always thought him very nice and polite.”
</p>
<p>“Lili, how can you tell such disgraceful fibs? You always thought him unbearable.”
</p>
<p>“But, Marie, that is no reason surely why I should not go skating with him,” cried
Lili, almost in an imploring tone. “When you go to a dance I am sure you are not so
particular about your partners.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Still, I hardly know what to think about it,” Marie persisted teasingly. “All at
once on the ice together.—Mamma, do you think ’tis right?”
</p>
<p>Lili turned away with dignified contempt.
</p>
<p>“Child that you are!” she said, looking down upon her sister; and she was much annoyed
at herself, for she felt herself blushing, and—for nothing at all.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“Papa is asleep?” asked Georges, as he entered Emilie’s sitting-room in the evening
after dinner.
</p>
<p>Emilie gave a little start; she was somewhat under the influence of a copious meal;
her chair was so comfortable, the fire so sociable.
</p>
<p>“Yes; papa is asleep,” she repeated, blinking her eyes.
</p>
<p>Georges laughed.
</p>
<p>“And how about Emilie; has she been asleep too?” he asked good-humouredly.
</p>
<p>“No,” she answered. “I have not been asleep, only dozing a little. Will you stay at
home to tea? Yes, that will be sociable.”
</p>
<p>And she looked at him with a kindly expression in her honest eyes; she felt a sort
of motherly affection for that younger brother, whom she had brought up and petted
from his childhood, and who had now returned to her fostering care after a two months’
absence abroad. She was glad that he was looking so well, he had even grown stouter,
and with pride she remarked that a more manly expression lay over his delicate features,
or was it her fancy, because she had not seen him for some time?
</p>
<p>Georges sat down beside her, and they conversed about things in general. She knew
him well, she thought, and she felt sure that he was about to ask her some favour.
Inwardly she was glad that he needed her, but still she could not resist the temptation
to leave him to shift for himself entirely, without helping him to come to the point.
He hesitated a great deal, and when from her assumed indifference he judged that it
was not the right moment to speak, he seemed of a sudden determined to postpone what
he had to say, and in a firmer voice began talking about something else. Then she
felt sorry, and said but little in reply, whilst she tried to think of some means
to lead him back to his original intention. But she could find no pretext whatever,
and so she cut the matter short at once by straightway asking him—
</p>
<p>“I say, Georges, what is it? What have you to tell me?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now it was his turn to pretend indifference, and with assumed surprise he answered—
</p>
<p>“To tell you? How do you mean?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know; I thought—I fancied I could see something in the ends of your moustache,”
she said jokingly. “Is there nothing the matter, really? Money affairs, perhaps?”
</p>
<p>She knew better, they were no money affairs, it was never anything to do with money
affairs, for in money matters he was always so desperately precise that she could
never find the slightest flaw in that quarter. And indeed he shook his head in denial,
but still, though he looked at her smilingly, he got no farther; his question must
indeed be an awkward one if it made such a ready talker as he hesitate.
</p>
<p>“Oh no,” he answered. “’Tis all said in a few words, but there are times when words
will not come at all; isn’t it so?”
</p>
<p>“Look here, Georges, don’t beat about the bush, pray; if you have anything to say
or to ask of me, come out with it straight away, without mincing matters, that is
quite unnecessary with me!” she resumed almost reproachfully, but with such an encouraging
tenderness that he grasped her white hand, and with playful gallantry raised it to
his lips.
</p>
<p>“And now, <i lang="fr">allons</i>! fire away!” Emilie urged, giving him a light tap under the chin.
</p>
<p>He was forced to speak, he could not go back, and he gathered up his courage and began
slowly in broken sentences, but soon came to the point. His position—would she think
it very foolish of him, if he—thought of getting married? There was a tremor in his
voice, as though his fate depended on her answer.
</p>
<p>His words took her by surprise; despite his twenty-four years, she still looked upon
him in some way as her boy, her pet child, and—he thought of getting married! But
notwithstanding the superficial gloss of his airy manner, she knew him to be manly
and sensible; he would not ask her such a thing if he had not thoroughly thought it
out, and it would be wrong of her to wound him, perhaps in a deep-seated affection,
by one word of banter. Still she felt alarmed at the thought of sooner or later losing
him.
</p>
<p>“Marry! Georges, do you really think of it?”
</p>
<p>He smiled, as though charmed at some bright vision.
</p>
<p>“Why not?” he asked, almost in a whisper.
</p>
<p>“Are you—are you then—so much in love?” she asked softly. <span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>“Is it——?” and a name rose to her lips, but she failed to pronounce it.
</p>
<p>He nodded his head, laughingly, as though he knew that she had guessed right. Some
time before his departure to Berlin, already she had teased him about Lili Verstraeten,
about whom he always had such a lot to say. But now that he acknowledged it, she felt
disappointed. How did he know that Lili could care for him? Was he not building castles
in the air? But she did not give expression to the thought; she would not shatter
his illusion, he seemed so happy in his quiet hopefulness.
</p>
<p>“Georges, if you are in earnest, really—well, let us consider now,” and she moved
her chair closer to his. “Suppose it all goes smoothly at first, say you propose,
and she accepts you, what then? How long won’t you have to wait before it can come
to a marriage?”
</p>
<p>“Why?”
</p>
<p>“But, Georges, whatever do you mean? How simple you are! You surely don’t intend to
marry on your salary as assistant-consul? Twelve hundred florins, is it not? ’Tis
true you are entitled to your share of mamma’s legacy, but it is only a trifle, all
in all you won’t be very rich. So I ask you, on what are you going to marry then?
You cannot depend much on what the Verstraetens will give as a dowry; they live well,
but simply; they are not really wealthy.”
</p>
<p>“My dear Emilie, if you want to reckon at all, then reckon properly. ’Tis true, on
the support of my intended parents-in-law—if they will ever be that,” he whispered
smiling, “I—don’t reckon at all; in fact I should not even care about it.”
</p>
<p>“For all that, you would not say no, if they were to come forward with anything substantial.”
</p>
<p>“I don’t know; that is a factor which I shall put aside for the present, in fact I
haven’t even given it a thought; but you were reckoning up just now, and you reckoned
rather carelessly. Suppose I don’t pass my examination as vice-consul this year, is
my share to the legacy not fifteen hundred florins?”
</p>
<p>“About that.”
</p>
<p>“Well, twelve hundred plus fifteen hundred makes——”
</p>
<p>“Two thousand seven hundred florins! And would you marry on that?”
</p>
<p>“Why not?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>She clasped her hands in despair.
</p>
<p>“But, Georges, you are—<i lang="fr">pardonnez-moi le mot</i>—you are out of your senses. Don’t be a child, pray, and don’t create illusions out
of impossibilities. Perhaps you have got hold of that little book—let me see, what
is it called? ‘How to live a comfortable married life on fifteen hundred florins.’ ”
</p>
<p>“No; I don’t know the book, but fifteen hundred is not two thousand seven hundred
florins, and I flatter myself——”
</p>
<p>“You flatter yourself! Yes, you will do a lot! Are you a fellow to jog along with
a wife from January to December on a wretched couple of thousand gulden? Yes, indeed
you will do a lot,” she repeated excitedly, and almost angry, when he wanted to interrupt
her, and she rose excitedly from her easy-chair. “I fancy I see you, established in
apartments on the second floor, luxuriating on a beefsteak once a week, eh! However,
’tis a life <i>I</i> can’t describe to you. I don’t know anything about it, that I will confess. You are
used to good living, Lili also; how are you two going to—? Oh! come, ’tis too absurd.
Do be sensible, Georges! I know you too well——”
</p>
<p>“It seems you do not <i>quite</i>,” he interrupted in his low voice, which contrasted with her indignant tone. “At
all events, I think I have the faculty to be able to regulate my wants in proportion
to my means.”
</p>
<p>“Maybe you do, but how about your wife? Would you force a young girl, brought up with
a certain amount of luxury, also to regulate her wants according to your means? Believe
me, Georges, nowadays people do not live on love and moonshine, and young people like
yourself, like Lili, must have some luxuries, they must go out——”
</p>
<p>“Oh! that eternal going out. I went out when I was a youth; surely one need not always
to be going out.”
</p>
<p>“Egotist! Therefore, because you as a youth went out as much as you liked, you want
to marry and stay at home for economy, and sit with your wife luxuriating over your
weekly beefsteak. What a grand prospect for her, to be sure!”
</p>
<p>“But, Emilie, why must you lay such a stress on the urgent necessity of going out
every evening? I don’t see it myself, I must admit. I base my happiness on something
altogether different.”
</p>
<p>“Up to this moment you have been as gay a butterfly as any <span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>one of them—in short, you have gone out. Now you are in love you have had a little
poesy infused into your ideas; but believe me, that will wear off, and when you have
been married a little while you will find it very sociable indeed to have a pleasant
circle of acquaintances.”
</p>
<p>“Granted, as far as the circle of acquaintances is concerned; but to give them up
is no part of my plan, and it will not cost so very much to keep up their friendship.”
</p>
<p>“It costs a <span class="corr" id="xd31e2523" title="Source: greal">great</span> deal, Georges, believe me,” urged Emilie. “You receive invitations; you don’t want
to be considered mean; you must give a little dinner, however unpretentious; you have
to do so again and again, and all this, mind you, you have to manage on two thousand
seven hundred gulden, eh? Well, I fancy I can see you at it already. Especially your
wife, who has to keep house on those two thousand seven hundred gulden, or rather
on as much of it as you allow her. Anyhow, you won’t catch me coming to stay with
you, do you hear?”
</p>
<p>He laughed at her indignation, but still he did not yield himself vanquished.
</p>
<p>“Emilie, don’t excite yourself about nothing at all, pray!” he said calmly. “Up to
now ’tis all in the air yet, eh? I have not yet—taken a step—I don’t know even whether——”
</p>
<p>He did not complete the sentence, hesitating to express in words the thoughts that
seemed so disagreeable.
</p>
<p>“Yes, Georges, I understand,” she replied, somewhat appeased by the calm of his voice;
“but still financial circumstances can hardly be put off as second considerations;
this much you will admit.”
</p>
<p>“Of course; but you must not fix my budget too high. By the bye, dear,” he interrupted
himself with a winning smile, “talking about a budget—just help me to arrange one,
will you?”
</p>
<p>“What! of a total of two thousand seven hundred gulden? Impossible, Georges, I am
not equal to the task. Why, to live respectably in apartments, unmarried, you would
want more.”
</p>
<p>He sighed.
</p>
<p>“Then we can’t agree about the matter at all?”
</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders.
</p>
<p>“You are a child to persist in such foolish ideas. You don’t know what life is.”
</p>
<p>She was annoyed that he was so obstinate, and would not listen <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>to her good advice, but he—although he would not have admitted it—felt himself hesitate
a little in his so-long-thought-out ideas; he felt a burden of hopelessness overwhelming
him, and saw the ground of his expectations glide away from under his feet. Slowly
he passed his hand across his forehead; it were better perhaps—if he waited.
</p>
<p>“Perhaps—I should—do better to—wait!” he whispered, giving expression to the thoughts
that oppressed, and his words were so full of sad resignation that Emilie, notwithstanding
the victory she had achieved, felt pained.
</p>
<p>She took his head in both her hands, and looked long into his sad, wistful eyes.
</p>
<p>“You dreamer!” she said, full of motherly tenderness and sympathy. “Who knows, eh?
You are so young—and perhaps, who knows, perhaps——”
</p>
<p>“Well—perhaps what?”
</p>
<p>“Perhaps you are right, and I am all wrong,” casting aside her victory at the sorrow
it caused her spoilt boy. “Only, think well over it; be sensible, Georges, I beg of
you!”
</p>
<p>And she pressed a loving kiss on his eyelids, which closed, and beneath which she
felt a suspicious moisture.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Adieu, Betsy! good-night, Henk! I am going to lie down, I am tired out!” said Eline
in one breath, while still in the hall.
</p>
<p>“Won’t you take a snack of supper first?” asked Betsy.
</p>
<p>“No, thank you.”
</p>
<p>She walked up-stairs, while Betsy shrugged her shoulders. Betsy knew her and her ways,
and from the curt, determined words she guessed that Eline was in one of those moods
of nervous excitability in which she almost hated any one who attempted to dissuade
her from her intentions.
</p>
<p>“What is the matter with Eline?” asked Henk anxiously, when they had entered the dining-room.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Oh, how should I know?” cried Betsy. “It commenced at the concert, and in the carriage
she did not even answer me, as you must have noticed. I don’t trouble about it, but
I think Eline intolerable when she has those ridiculous fits.”
</p>
<p>Calm and dignified, in her swan’s-down and plush, Eline walked up-stairs and entered
her sitting-room. The gas was alight, and a log of wood burnt on the hearth. For a
moment she looked round, then tore the white lace from her hair, and the little cloak
from her shoulders, and with bowed head and staring eyes gazed in front of her with
a vacant expression, as though crushed under the weight of a terrible disappointment.
</p>
<p>In the little Venetian mirror, gracefully suspended with red cords and tassels, above
the white group of Amor and Psyche, whose idyllic appearance was in mocking contrast
with the irony of her thoughts, she saw herself reflected, glistening in “her pink
rep silk,” a pink aigrette in her hair, the same in which, three months ago, she had
first seen Fabrice.
</p>
<p>And now—
</p>
<p>She almost laughed aloud, she thought herself so ridiculous, she felt a loathing for
herself, as if she had been dabbling in the mire.
</p>
<p>There had been a concert of the Diligentia Society at the Hall of Arts and Sciences,
and at her request, Henk and Betsy had accompanied her there. Fabrice was to sing;
“the popular baritone of the French Opera had been invited to gather fresh laurels
at the concerts in the Hall,” so ran the paragraph in <i lang="nl">Het Vaderland</i>.
</p>
<p>Eline did not rest until she was certain of going; at first she had asked the Verstraetens;
Madame Verstraeten did not feel inclined, Lili was still ill; then she asked Emilie—Emilie
had an engagement; at last she came to Henk and Betsy, who, although neither of them
were much in love with concerts, agreed to go. And Eline had expected great things
in seeing Fabrice in a new sphere, that of a concert-singer. Fortunately enough, their
seats were close to the stage; he—oh! he must have noticed her at the opera, he would
give her a sign, he loved her—the Bucchi fan! And so Eline went on, creating endless
illusions; her passion filled her mind, more and more with a second, imaginary, fantastic
existence, in which Fabrice and she were the hero and heroine; a romance of improbabilities
and a constantly growing web of poetical extravagance.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>He thought her beautiful, he worshipped her, they would fly, sing on the stage, and
through poverty and privation pass on to fame and fortune. A feverish rapture at the
thought that she would once more see him diffused a light pink tint over the amber
pallor of her features, her eyes had sparkled in the veiled glow of her languishing
glances; and—They had gone, she had taken her seat, resplendent with a beauty that
had drawn glass after glass towards her, and the first notes of the symphony sounded
in her ears as the soft strains of a hymn, laden with joyful whisperings of love and
happiness. Then—then he appeared, amid a thunder of applause.
</p>
<p>And just now, whilst Eline was vacantly staring into the mirror in front of her, she
once more pictured him as he appeared on the concert platform.
</p>
<p>Clumsily, like a stout carpenter, in a dress-coat that seemed too tight for him, his
short crisp hair greasy and slimy with <i lang="fr">cosmétique</i>, plastered down upon his cheeks, his face as red as a lobster, in contrast to the
spotless white of his shirt-front, he presented a coarse and prosy appearance, with
a disagreeably sullen expression about his bearded mouth and in his blinking, half-closed
eyes, shaded by thick, bushy eyebrows. And it seemed to Eline as though it were the
first time she saw him. All the charm with which he, in his talented vivid acting,
in the brilliant dresses which displayed his figure to the greatest advantage, had
exerted over her, was now dispelled as by one strong gust of wind; and though his
voice resounded with the same splendid metallic ring which had filled her with rapture
at the opera, she was scarcely aware that he was singing, shocked as she was at her
gigantic mistake.
</p>
<p>Had she then had no eyes? What! that prosy carpenter the ideal of her fantastic brain!
In her despair and disappointment she could have sobbed with chagrin, but not a feature
moved, and she remained sitting immovable, almost stiff; but a light shudder ran through
her, as she drew the cloak about her shoulders. As long as he sang she looked at him
from top to toe, as though she would no longer spare herself, and her breath came
and went quick with agitation now that she plunged into the depths of her sorrow without
being able to give vent to it. Why had she not seen him thus when she met him in the
Bosch, in his cape, with his muffler and his big felt, that gave him a romantic appearance,
something of an Italian brigand? Had she indeed so far forgotten herself? Shuddering,
she glanced round the room. No one <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>seemed to notice her, no one suspected the storm of disappointment that raged within
her; Fabrice absorbed the attention of all. Fortunately none knew, none would know.
</p>
<p>But the thought that she was safe from the eye of the world gave her no comfort. Before
her lay the shattered ruins of the airy, glass edifice of her tender visions and fancies,
which, pillar by pillar, light and delicate, she had erected for herself, glittering
and fair, higher and higher still, in fantastic crystal splendour, ever higher, higher,
until as with an apotheosis it seemed to reach the very clouds.
</p>
<p>And now, all was shattered, all visions and fancies of the brain were vanished, dispelled
as by one gust of wind, and not even a chaos was left of it all, only a terrible vacuum,
only that man there, with his red butcher’s face and his white shirt, and his tight-fitting
coat and grease-beplastered hair.
</p>
<p>Never had she suffered as she suffered that evening.
</p>
<p>For three long months that romance of love had caused her heart to beat each time
his name was pronounced in her presence, each time she saw his name announced on a
placard, and now—one glance at that (Vincent’s words re-echoed in her ears, full of
mockery and derision) “stout ugly customer” tore that romance out of her soul, and
all—all was gone.
</p>
<p>She scarcely spoke, and when in the <i>foyer</i> Betsy, noticing her drawn pallid features, asked her whether she was ill, Eline calmly
replied in the affirmative—yes, she did feel rather faint. They met the Oudendyks
and the van Larens, they laughed and joked, they mentioned Fabrice’s name, but Eline
sank down on a bench, like a wounded dove, and listened, nearly swooning with grief,
understanding nothing, and with a vacant smile, to something young Hydrecht was saying
to her.
</p>
<p>In the second part of the concert Fabrice appeared again, and again he was received
with jubilant applause, and Eline felt faint and giddy. It was as though the public
in their mad admiration were dancing a satanic dance round about the baritone, sullen,
red, and coarse as ever. Cold drops of perspiration formed on her brow, her hands
felt cold and clammy in their tight-fitting covering of <i lang="fr">peau de Suède</i>, and her bosom heaved with long, oppressive gasps of breath. At last—thank Heaven!—the
concert was over.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Now she was alone, and she could allow herself to be swayed as <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>much as she chose by that storm of grief; she need no longer nerve herself to appear
bright and smiling before the world; and so, with a sob of anguish, she fell upon
her knees before the Persian sofa, and hid her little throbbing head in the embroidery
of the soft cushions. With her hands she tried to quench the gasping sobs that shook
all her delicate frame, her hair came away from the clasp that held it, and fell about
her, a mass of glossy waves.
</p>
<p>After the first grief and disappointment, a bitter feeling overmastered her, as though
she had, even were it but in her own eyes, rendered herself up to an ineffaceable
ridicule, to something that was unworthy and ludicrous, the stain of which would for
ever cling to her, and of which the memory would ever continue to haunt her, like
a mocking, grinning phantom.
</p>
<p>Long she remained thus, her head buried in the cushions, her whole being writhing
in the anguish of her despair. First she heard Henk, then Betsy, retiring to their
rooms, and then Gerard bolting the street door for the night, the sound re-echoing
through the silence that reigned in the house. After that nothing stirred, and Eline
felt herself very lonely, as though forsaken in the midst of an ocean of sorrow.
</p>
<p>All at once, a thought made her start. Quickly she raised herself up, while the brown
hair whirled about her shoulders, and an expression of wounded pride came over her
tear-stained face. With a firm resolution and apparent calmness, she approached her
writing-desk, and shuddering placed the key in the lock, opened the drawer once so
dear to her, and took the album out of it. The red velvet seemed to scorch her fingers
like fire. She pushed a chair by the side of the hearth, where the log of wood was
still aglow with fire; she opened the book. That, then, was the shrine of her love,
the temple of her passion, in which she had worshipped her idol! And as she turned
the pages, the procession of portraits passed along: Ben-Saïd, Hamlet, Tell, Luna,
Nelusco, Alphonse, de Nevers—for the last time. Roughly, the gilt-edged leaves tearing
under her fingers, she removed the photographs, one by one, and without hesitation
tore them up in little pieces, cracking the hard cardboard in the angry clutch of
her delicate fingers. The pieces she cast into the fire, one by one, and while the
flames were curling round them she continued her work of destruction, and threw more
and still more into the <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>fire, stirring it up with the poker, until it was all burnt out. That was past, that
shame was purged.
</p>
<p>Then she rose, somewhat relieved. But the torn album, which she still held in her
fingers, continued to scorch her hand, and suddenly grasping the velvet book, so roughly
that it split her finger-nails, she hurled it, with a subdued cry of abhorrence, far
away from her, against the piano, the chords of which gave forth a dull, low sigh.
</p>
<p>Then she picked up her cloak and her lace from the floor, smoothed the rumpled silk
of her dress, and retired to her bedroom, where a small milk-white night-lamp diffused
a soft, sad light around.
</p>
<p>And it seemed to her as if anew she was plunged into that ocean of sorrow, that abyss
of disappointments, whilst all at once a dispute with Betsy rose to her mind. But
a few days ago, in fact, she had declared that Roberts, her music-master, was growing
old and was no longer any good, that she intended in future to take lessons of an
artiste—of Fabrice, for instance—and Betsy had asked her if she was mad, and had declared
that such a thing should certainly not be done in her house.
</p>
<p>It need not be now.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The severity of the winter relaxed, and spring-time drew near, bringing with it rain
and chill mists, which enveloped the leafless trees in damp cold shrouds. And everybody
talked about Otto van Erlevoort, who was so full of attention for Eline Vere. Oh yes;
it would certainly end in an engagement, thought the Eekhofs, the Hydrechts, the van
Larens, and Madame van der Stoor. Henk had been to Gelderland with Etienne; they had
stayed at the Huis ter Horze, the seat of the Erlevoort family, where Theodore, the
eldest son, lived summer and winter, with his wife and children; and during that time
Otto had been a frequent visitor at the Nassauplein, being, ’tis true, mostly invited
to spend the evening there, in company with others; but still, was it not very <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>strange that he who generally led such a quiet life and went out so little, should
all at once visit the van Raats so frequently? However, should it come to an engagement,
it would be a capital match. Otto was a nice boy, and had a good position; Eline was
most charming, elegant, rich, as was thought; they were cut out for each other; and
besides, Eline would be glad to get a baron for her husband. In fact people thought
them so well matched that they felt rather sorry at finding nothing much to say against
it, and they searched until at last they found something. It was really Betsy’s doings,
you see, for she did not get along too well with her sister, and would not be sorry
to see her leave the house decently. Betsy encouraged Otto; it was true Eline seemed
willing, but if it had not been for Betsy, neither he nor she would have thought of
it. Oh yes; Betsy, she was all right in company, but in the house a <i lang="fr">maîtresse femme</i>? No, no; worse than that—a vixen! Good stout Henk she had entirely under her slipper,
and if Eline were not so firm, and showed her teeth a little less, she too would have
got under her thumb. On the face of it, it seemed so nice, so kind, to take a younger
sister, an orphan, into the house, but to people who were so wealthy as the van Raats
that meant nothing. Besides that, the Veres had money too, and nobody believed that
it was all <i lang="fr">couleur de rose</i> in the house. Therefore, Betsy found it was time that Eline should marry. She could
have had the chance often enough already; but she was pretty and hard to please, and
so forth. Anyhow, it was her business, was it not?
</p>
<p>Eline was well aware that people talked about her in that way, but in her calm dignity
she troubled herself precious little about it. She believed so too; Otto would propose
to her, and she thought she had better accept him. She felt no love, ’twas true—in
the way that she understood its meaning—for van Erlevoort, but there was not the slightest
objection to him. It would be a capital match; she might have liked a larger fortune,
but she thought that with her refined frugality she would have sufficient tact to
spread a semblance of luxury about her.
</p>
<p>But to say that Betsy encouraged Otto was going a little too far. Betsy, although
she looked upon such a marriage as very desirable, felt no personal sympathy for Otto,
who was too formal and precise to please her; and she was polite and friendly towards
him, but never betrayed the slightest sign that she thought him a desirable brother-in-law.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the van Erlevoorts’, too, some rather indiscreet questions had now and then been
put; but Frédérique merely shrugged her shoulders. She knew of nothing; Eline had
been engaged so often already—in the eyes of her acquaintances at least—why then should
she not be engaged for once to Otto? she asked, so ironically that they could not
guess at the truth. And still she was aware that mysterious interviews sometimes took
place at home between Madame van Erlevoort, Mathilde, and Otto, a sort of family council
that seemed never to come to a decision. She felt herself a little pushed aside, and
she was too proud, now that they despised her advice, and did not seem to care for
her opinion, to force herself upon them. Once even, when she had mamma, her sister,
and brother together after dinner, and had noticed they had suddenly ceased speaking
when she entered, while her hand was still on the handle of the door—they had looked
at her with some embarrassment—she had disappeared, without saying a word, softly
closing the door behind her, in silent grief and chagrin. With Otto, too, after their
conversation about the fan, she sought no further confidence, for did he not look
upon her as a mere child? Very well, she would not trouble him with her childishness.
And only to Lili and Marie she gave herself vent about Eline, that vain coquette,
without a spark of feeling in all her smiles and poses; but when Paul was present
she was silent. He took her part, too, another victim to Eline’s coquetry, just the
same as Etienne, who would not hear a word against her! What did all those boys see
in her? She could not understand it; she thought Eline nothing but artificiality and
affectation, an actress; in short, Eline was acting. And although Etienne’s pleading
for Eline annoyed her, she felt herself, now that he was away at the Horze, lonely
without him, in the midst of the bustle of the little van Ryssels and the barking
of Hector, betwixt which Miss Frantzen made desperate efforts to restore peace and
quietness.
</p>
<p>It was Sunday, and Paul van Raat sat before his easel, upon which there lay a half-finished
picture, representing some old Delft ware, an old Bible, an antique Rhine wine-glass,
and a silver ewer, that of Vincent’s, which he had taken after all—the whole loosely
arranged on a broad, crumpled Smyrna table-cover. But the work proceeded very slowly;
the light was and remained faint, however he might raise or drop his curtains, and
he regretted to find that his fingers could with much more ease arrange the objects
<span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>tastefully, than they could afterwards depict them on the canvas. It was all the fault
of the weather! with such a rainy sky there could sparkle no light in the wine-glass,
whilst it gave the silver ewer the appearance of tin. And he laid aside his brush,
and with his hands in his pockets, and whistling to himself, walked up and down his
studio, a little annoyed at his want of energy. He would so gladly have finished it,
but he could not, exert himself though he might.
</p>
<p>His room was one artistic chaos, even as his amateurish temperament was a chaos, out
of which a creation rarely came forth. Above a carved oak cupboard hung a trophy of
ancient weapons; the walls, up to the ceiling, were covered with china, paintings,
engravings, and etchings, and female figures in marble and terra-cotta seemed to surround
him, as with a harem of milk-white and amber-coloured beauties. Books were scattered
about everywhere, out of untied portfolios peeped forth sketches and engravings; on
the ground, round about the easel, lay a medley of brushes, pencils, and tubes. A
large ash-tray was full of ashes, and everywhere there was dust and rubbish. Leentje,
the parlour-maid, was seldom permitted to enter this room.
</p>
<p>And whilst in his disappointment he walked up and down, it seemed to him as though
it would be a relief to clear away all this artistic rubbish, throw his easel in the
lumber-room, and never more think of a brush. It seemed to him that when once his
room were cleared of art, he himself would have no further longing for art, and therefore
suffer no more disappointments. It was only a waste of time; he could find better
amusement than that eternal dabbling. And he thought how he would re-arrange his room,
simple and comfortable, so that one could move about without throwing down a statue
here, or stumbling over an Eastern rug there. Still, the thought was tinged with sadness;
it was all illusion, long since shattered and cast down from its pedestal, the last
remnants of which he was now about to clear away.
</p>
<p>All at once he heard Eline’s laughing voice in the hall, and he went down-stairs into
the back sitting-room, and kissed his mother; she had come with Ben. Betsy invited
Madame van Raat to come round that evening; there would be no one there besides Madame
Eekhof and her two daughters, Ange and Léonie, Frédérique and her two brothers, and
Vincent.
</p>
<p>“Of course, we depend on you also, Paul,” she said, as she <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>gave him her hand. “<i lang="fr">Cela s’entend, n’est-ce pas?</i> Come, little madam, you had better say yes; it won’t be nice at all of you to refuse;
you may go at your usual early hour, if you like. <i lang="fr">Ce n’est pas à refuser.</i>”
</p>
<p>Well, little madam would consent; but she really did not feel at home with all that
youth about her.
</p>
<p>“That’s just the thing that does you good, a little cheerfulness. Look at Madame van
Erlevoort,” said Eline; “take example by her.”
</p>
<p>The old lady was not proof against the temptation of her darling’s voice, and gave
herself over; Paul, too, promised to come. And Madame van Raat looked at Eline, who
sat beside her on the sofa, with some curiosity, as though she were revolving something
in her mind.
</p>
<p>“I say, Eline, I must ask you something,” commenced Madame van Raat at length, in
a whisper. “Is it true?”
</p>
<p>Eline felt a faint blush tinge her cheeks, but she acted as though she did not understand
the question.
</p>
<p>“What, little madam? how do you mean?” The old lady smiled, but gave no explanation.
She only asked—
</p>
<p>“Frédérique is coming too this evening, is she not?”
</p>
<p>“I think so, at least——” began Eline.
</p>
<p>“Alone?”
</p>
<p>“No; with—as I said just now—with her brothers, Otto and Etienne.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, indeed,” said the old lady indifferently; but she looked at her askance, whilst
something like joy played in her lustreless eyes.
</p>
<p>Eline smiled, a little embarrassed.
</p>
<p>“I think you are a very naughty old lady,” she said, stroking her muff.
</p>
<p>“Oh, people talk so much, you know; don’t they? One hears this one day, that the next;
but still, sometimes one hears the truth too.”
</p>
<p>“And what have you heard?”
</p>
<p>“Something you ought to have told me long ago, if you had placed any confidence in
me. Now I had to learn it from Betsy.”
</p>
<p>Eline started.
</p>
<p>“Did Betsy say——?” she stammered.
</p>
<p>“Yes, deary; and I had much rather have heard it from you <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>first,” repeated Madame van Raat, feeling hurt, as an old lady who has been slighted.
</p>
<p>Eline grew impatient. It was true Otto had asked her, but she could not yet decide,
and it annoyed her. How every one seemed to know about it, and gave her unasked advice!
how every one in veiled and open terms dared to make all sorts of representations
to Betsy! others, under the cloak of intimacy, had even whispered in her sister’s
ears that she should urge Eline to declare herself. She now had had enough of these
indiscretions, and she was on the point of giving Madame van Raat a sharp answer,
but she restrained herself, and gave no sign of her annoyance, whilst she murmured
close to the old lady’s ear—
</p>
<p>“Well, what should I have told you? It is true Erlevoort <i>has</i> proposed to me; but I could not talk about it before I knew myself what I should
do.”
</p>
<p>And she just glanced at Paul, but quickly turned her head away again, feeling annoyed
too with him, for he looked at her intently, as if he wanted to catch her words. Anyhow,
she was not going to satisfy their unmannerly curiosity, and she rose and put a stop
to Madame van Raat’s chat—from which it appeared that the old lady liked Otto very
much—with a kiss and a few little words of endearment.
</p>
<p>And the increased lovingness of Madame van Raat’s trembling kiss, no less than the
playfulness that twinkled in Paul’s eyes, annoyed and irritated her, whilst she was
waiting for Ben, as his grandma was still caressing him in her arms.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>No; Eline did not know how to decide. She shuddered at taking a step that could make
her happy or unhappy for life. It seemed to her as though her future depended only
on one single word, which she hesitated to utter. She shuddered at the very idea of
a <i lang="fr">mariage de raison</i>, because in her heart she felt a longing for love, much love, although it was a feeling
which she had done her best to repress after her recent disappointment. And Otto—she
had danced with him, had laughed and joked with him, but never had his image held
her thoughts even for a moment, and she had always forgotten him as soon as she heard
or saw him no longer. When, however, she saw through his earnest simplicity of character,
when she guessed that he loved her, the idea was sweet to her, and she told herself
that it would pain her were she to cause him grief, or to <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>refuse him anything, even her hand. And whilst she thus wilfully blinded herself,
the rapture of his quiet passion for her seemed to pour balm into her wounded heart.
</p>
<p>The thought of becoming his wife, under the influence of her self-deception, filled
her with a serene joy; something like a sweet vision arose to her mind, and—she began
to look at the matter from a financial point of view.
</p>
<p>Yes; the idea was a cheering one. To be quite independent, to leave her sister’s house,
where, notwithstanding her own little private fortune, she felt as though she were
in fetters, something like a troublesome guest, whose presence was tolerated for the
sake of the world’s opinion. But beneath all these various reasons which allured her
to welcome Otto with a calm pleasure, there lurked, like an adder as it were, invisible
to her own eye, the bitter regret at the ruin of her shattered fantasies, and if ever
she gave herself away to Otto, it would be in order to be avenged on Fabrice, and
on herself.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, as soon as he had proposed, as soon as it became necessary for her
to reflect, and there was no overwhelming wealth of passion to which she could yield
herself up, she had stepped back full of terror at the ordeal of giving her decision.
</p>
<p>He, Otto, waited; he at least was discreet. For some days past he had avoided the
house of the van Raats, and she wanted to reward him for his discretion; blushingly
she had asked Betsy to send him a personal, intimate invitation, as she did to Freddie
and Etienne.
</p>
<p>He would come, she would speak to him; and it seemed to her as if some unseen power
pushed her forward down a steep path; as if she would act otherwise than she did,
but that she was powerless to escape her fate. It seemed to her as though, blindfolded,
she groped about after her happiness, stretching forth her hands in anxious, breathless
suspense, and listening to something that seemed like the echo of the happiness that
she was never, never to find.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Betsy poured out the tea. Madame van Raat and Madame Eekhof sat beside her on a sofa,
and conversed with Emilie de Woude. Henk, with his hands in his pockets, was listening
attentively to Vincent, and Eline, Ange, Léonie, and Paul were turning over some music
at the piano, when Otto and Etienne entered.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>“And Frédérique?” asked Betsy with surprise, as she held out her hand to Otto.
</p>
<p>“Frédérique felt a little tired; she is very sorry,” he answered simply.
</p>
<p>“She is often out of sorts lately,” said Etienne, as though to add some weight to
his brother’s words.
</p>
<p>Eline felt her heart beat. She was very nervous, although she effectually concealed
her nervousness under her happy cheerfulness. It suddenly seemed to her as if every
one were looking at her, were guessing at her thoughts, and she nearly shuddered to
raise her eyes, out of fear at seeing the glance of all directed upon her. But still,
when she looked up, the aspect of the room was quite unchanged; the old ladies were
still chatting with Betsy and Emilie, Vincent was speaking almost in whispers to Henk,
and the girls and Paul were shaking hands with Etienne.
</p>
<p>But Otto approached her. She scarcely knew how to carry herself, and fancied she looked
very awkward; but it was just that very hesitancy that lent something coy to her slender
little figure, and gave her a new charm. She heard how he simply bade her good evening,
but in his voice there sounded something full and rich, like the promise of a great
affection. She suddenly felt conscious of a fresh emotion, a melting tenderness in
her heart which she could not understand.
</p>
<p>He remained standing there, by the piano, at her side; but entered into conversation
with Ange, while Léonie was engaged in boisterous fun with Etienne. Once or twice
Otto glanced at Eline to make her participate in their chat, and she smiled, without
hearing what passed. She could no longer follow her thoughts; they fluttered about
in her mind like a swarm of butterflies, and it seemed to her as though a chorus of
voices was singing in her ears. She understood that she might not allow herself to
be drawn into the luxurious softness which seemed to encircle her as with velvet arms,
that she durst not give herself up to dreams in the midst of a room full of people.
And after a few laughing words she turned away, wondering at the subdued tone of her
voice, which sounded as though she was speaking through a veil.
</p>
<p>“Vincent, you play too, don’t you?” she heard Betsy ask, and she saw the old ladies
and Emilie rise, and caught sight of Henk seated at the card-table in the opposite
room, and busily picking out the pearl card-counters from a Japanese box. She seemed
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>be moving as in a dream; she saw the cards spread out on the red cloth-covered table
in the form of a big S; she saw the wax candles burning at the corners of the table,
and Madame Eekhof’s bejewelled fingers drawing a card.
</p>
<p>It seemed to her as though she herself was far away from it all. Vincent sat down
opposite Madame van Raat, Henk was to have Madame Eekhof for a partner. Betsy returned
with Emilie, they would join in later on.
</p>
<p>“Madame van Raat, shall we be disturbing them if we have a little music; or is it
such a terribly serious card-party?” Léonie asked of Betsy, pointing to the card-table.
</p>
<p>“Oh no, not at all, <i lang="fr">amusez vous toujours</i>,” answered Betsy, and she led Otto and Emilie with her to the sofa. To strangers
she was always most amiable.
</p>
<p>“Come, Eline, do let us hear you; deary, we are dying for your ravishing melodies!”
Léonie continued, with unextinguishable vivacity. “I will accompany you with my fairy
fingers.”
</p>
<p>“No, Léo; not this evening, please. I am not in voice.”
</p>
<p>“Not in voice? I don’t believe a word of it! Come! <i lang="fr">allons, chante ma belle!</i> what shall it be?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, Eline, do sing!” cried Madame van Raat from the opposite room, and then in an
embarrassed voice asked her partner what were trumps.
</p>
<p>“Really, little madam; really, Léo, I can’t. I can always tell when I can’t sing.
I don’t as a rule refuse, do I? But you have brought some music with you, have you
not?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; but they are not the sort of songs to commence with, they are for later in the
evening. Something serious first; come, Eline, <i lang="fr">allons</i>!”
</p>
<p>“No, no; positively not,” said Eline, shaking her head; it was really impossible.
She felt as though in a fever, which brought a faint blush to her cheeks, caused her
eyelids to droop languidly, made her pulses beat, her fingers tremble.
</p>
<p>“Positively not?” she heard softly repeated, and she glanced round. It was Otto, who,
seated beside Betsy and Emilie, asked her, and looked at her with his honest, expressive
eyes. Once more she shook her head, still, so she thought, awkwardly; but really with
unconscious grace.
</p>
<p>“Really, I could not.”
</p>
<p>And she turned away directly, fearing that he would suspect why. <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>Besides, she felt very embarrassed when her glance met his, although there was not
the slightest reproach in it. And it seemed to her as though there was something awkward
in the bearing of the people who filled the rooms with their chat and laughter, something
that was unusual and strange; but still, so she thought, only Betsy and Madame van
Raat knew that Otto had proposed to her, and that she would give him her answer that
evening. Whatever the others might suspect, they would not let a word escape her that
could compel her to lift the veil from her secret before she chose. And this confidence
in their well-bred discreetness reassured her.
</p>
<p>Léonie however pouted, and thought Eline a tiresome girl. Paul and Etienne cried that
Léo must sing, and were going to fetch her music, which the girl, with an affectation
of shyness, had left in the hall. All three rushed laughing to the door, but Léonie
would not permit them to look for the music, and they caused a sudden, cheerful stir,
that made the whist-players in the next room look up smiling from their cards. Etienne
however triumphed, and soon returned, carrying in his uplifted arms the score of <i>The Mascotte</i>. The young Eekhofs were persuaded, and laughing and halting they warbled, with their
thin, shrill little voices, the duet of Pipo and Betinna—
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O, mon Pipo, mon Dieu, qu’t’es bien!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">whilst Etienne accompanied them, with frequently doubtful chords.
</p>
<p>Still the duet was a success, and with rising gaiety they soon warbled, all four of
them—Ange, Léonie, Etienne, and Paul—with a delightful disregard both of time and
tune, now the languishing
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Un baiser est bien douce chose!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">then the comic
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Le grand singe d’Amérique!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and their music was wafted—a fluttering of airy melody—gaily through the rooms. Eline
had seated herself on a stool next the piano, and she leaned her feverish little head
against it, almost deafened with Etienne’s noisy voice. Her hand kept time on her
knee, thus still showing some little interest in what was going on. She heard the
chords of the piano drumming in her ears, and the sound of it prevented her from thinking
and coming to a decision. <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>Constantly she swayed from one resolution to another. Yes, she would accept; his love,
though not requited, would yet be her happiness; it was her destiny. No; she could
not force herself, she could not without a shadow of love allow herself to be bound
in this way. And it seemed to her as though her thoughts were continually swayed to
and fro, as if a clock were constantly ticking in her ears: yes—no—yes—no. It would
be a relief to grasp at anything, however blindly. No; she must only decide after
calm deliberation. Oh, if that clock would only cease! she could not struggle thus
with herself; she had not the strength. She would reflect no longer; she would let
herself be carried away by the invisible powers that drove her down the steep path;
she would yield herself up entirely to the stress of circumstances; <i>they</i> must decide for her. And she felt a cold shiver overtake her when their glances met,
and she rose.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Vincent addressed her.
</p>
<p>“Well, Elly, have you committed any folly yet; anything outrageously mad?” asked Vincent,
mocking her voice.
</p>
<p>Round the piano it was quieter. Léonie was seated beside Emilie, and was giving her
a vivid description of a little dance at the van Larens’. Etienne had turned himself
round on the piano-stool and was joking with Ange, who had tumbled on the ottoman
in a burst of laughter, and covered her face with both her little hands. Paul joined
in the laughter and turned over the pages of music.
</p>
<p>“How? what? how do you mean?” stammered Eline, who did not understand.
</p>
<p>“Did you not tell me, a little while ago, that you were about to do something desperately
absurd? now I ask you whether you have hit upon anything yet? I should like to join
you.”
</p>
<p>His banter grated on her ears. In her present unusually serious mood, the remembrance
of that period of frivolity seemed to her like an echo of vanished wishes. No; she
no longer had any desire to give herself over to equivocal absurdities; she would
be sensible and practical, as Otto was. Equivocally absurd, her disappointed passion—if
she might give that name to her folly—had been more than enough; in future she would
not let herself be carried away. And she crushed the feeling of bitter remorse that
rose in her heart with the sharp sting of an adder.
</p>
<p>While she was searching for some light phrase in answer to <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>Vincent’s question, a sudden alarm seized her. A new thought struck her. No, it was
no longer possible; she could not go back. Otto, Betsy, all expected her to accept;
they could not help doing so. If she did not intend to accept him, why then did she
have an express invitation sent him? It was settled. It could not be otherwise, and
after her sudden alarm a great calm came over her whole being.
</p>
<p>“But, my dear girl, I believe you suffer from absent-mindedness,” cried Vincent laughing.
He had asked her why Georges de Woude was not there, and she had languidly replied—
</p>
<p>“Oh, yes; that is true.”
</p>
<p>Now she laughed in her turn; she was coming to in the blissfulness of that calm.
</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, I have a little—” and she placed her hand on her forehead.
</p>
<p>“Oh! headache, I suppose? Yes; I know the disease,” he interrupted ironically, and
gave her a searching glance. “That headache is a family complaint with us; we suffer
a great deal from headache.”
</p>
<p>In some alarm she looked at him; surely he could not suspect anything.
</p>
<p>“I too got a headache whilst playing, under the hammering of the piano. It was as
though I saw all kinds of colours—green, yellow, orange. When that little lively girl
there—Léonie—sings, I always see orange colour.”
</p>
<p>“And when I sing?” she asked coquettishly.
</p>
<p>“Oh, then it is quite different,” he resumed, more seriously. “Then I always see before
me a harmonious climax, from faintest pink to purple, until the whole is fused together
in one delightful coalescence. Your low notes are pink, your high ones purple and
brilliant. When Paul sings ’tis all gray, with a tinge of violet sometimes.”
</p>
<p>She laughed gaily, and Paul—who had heard him—also.
</p>
<p>“But, Vincent, these are visions of an over-excited imagination.”
</p>
<p>“Perhaps so; but sometimes ’tis very pretty. Have you never experienced it?”
</p>
<p>She reflected for a moment, while Ange and Etienne, who had heard the latter part
of their conversation, came nearer and listened, as did Paul.
</p>
<p>“No; I don’t think I have.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p>“And have you never felt that some notes remind you of some particular odour—for instance,
opoponax or mignonette? The tones of an organ are like incense. When you sing that
scena of Beethoven, ‘Ah, Perfido!’ I always smell the scent of verbena, especially
in one of the concluding high passages. When you sing it again, I shall show you.”
</p>
<p>Ange roared with laughter.
</p>
<p>“But, Mr. Vere, how lovely to be perfumed like that!”
</p>
<p>All joined in the laugh, and Vincent too seemed in a good humour.
</p>
<p>“’Tis true, <i lang="fr">parole d’honneur</i>.”
</p>
<p>“No; but I tell you what, some people remind me of different animals,” whispered Etienne.
“Henk, for instance, reminds me of a big dog, Betsy of a hen, Madame van der Stoor
of a crab.”
</p>
<p>They screamed with laughter. Otto, Emilie, and Léonie rose from their seats and approached
nearer.
</p>
<p>“What is all this about?” asked Emilie inquisitively.
</p>
<p>“Madame van der Stoor is a crab!” yelled Ange, with tears in her eyes through laughing.
</p>
<p>“And tell me, Eetje, of what do I remind you?” asked Léonie with glistening eyes.
</p>
<p>“Oh, you and Ange are just like two little pups,” cried Etienne. “Miss de Woude, with
her double chin, is a turkey!” he whispered, wild with his success, in Ange’s ear,
who nearly choked with laughter. “Miss Frantzen is also a turkey, of another kind.
Willem the servant is a stately stork, and Dien, the cook at the Verstraetens’, a
cockatoo.”
</p>
<p>“’Tis a menagerie, a Noah’s ark!” screamed Léonie.
</p>
<p>“And Eline?” Paul asked at last.
</p>
<p>“Oh, Eline,” repeated Etienne, and reflected. “Sometimes a peacock—sometimes a serpent—at
this moment a little dove.”
</p>
<p>They shook their head at his extravagant fancies, but still they laughed gaily.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“Etienne is always jolly,” said Eline to Otto, when the little groups were broken
up, and she nodded smilingly at Madame van Raat, who had given her seat at the card-table
to Emilie. Vincent in the meantime became the butt of the little Eekhofs, who asked
him if he were going to open a perfumery store.
</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered Otto. “He has no reason to be otherwise, has he? He has all that he
desires.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>There was something sad in his words, as if that was not the case with himself, and
Eline could find nothing to reply. For a while they stood close together, in silence,
whilst her trembling hand clasped the fan at her side, and again her thoughts began
to stray.
</p>
<p>“Have you nothing to say to me?” he whispered softly, but without a tinge of reproach.
</p>
<p>She took a deep breath.
</p>
<p>“Really, oh—I—I cannot yet; forgive me, but really—later, later.”
</p>
<p>“All right, later; I will be patient—as long as I may be,” he said, and his calm tone
brought a little peace to her whirling brain. No; refuse she could no longer—but still,
she could not yet decide.
</p>
<p>And she could not help admiring his quiet tact, as he conversed with her on subjects
in which neither of them took the slightest interest. That simple, quiet tact constituted
his greatest charm; he was so entirely himself that it seemed as if his manly frankness
concealed nothing that the eyes of the world might not see. Whilst he spoke, he attempted
to cajole neither himself nor her that there was anything interesting in the conversation;
he seemed only to continue it because he liked to be near her and speak with her.
It was so evident in the full tones of his voice. His thoughts were not in his conversation,
and he made no attempt to conceal the fact. And for the first time she felt something
like pity for him; she felt that she was cruel, and that he was suffering, and this
feeling again aroused within her that melting tenderness which she could not understand.
Refreshments were handed round.
</p>
<p>“Will you take a lemonade, madam, and a cake?” Eline asked Madame van Raat, who was
sitting somewhat deserted on the sofa, now and again smiling at the joyous group of
young people who were engaged telling each other’s fortunes.
</p>
<p>“Wait a moment,” she continued to Otto; “the old lady is all alone; I shall go and
keep her company.”
</p>
<p>He gave her a friendly nod and went to listen to Paul’s horoscope, which Ange was
drawing for him.
</p>
<p>Eline took a lemonade, laid a cake on a dish, and offered it to Madame van Raat. Then
she sat down next to the old lady, and took her hand.
</p>
<p>Madame van Raat, however, never touched the refreshments, but looked Eline straight
in the eyes.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Well, how is it?” she asked.
</p>
<p>In her present mood of melting tenderness, Eline could not feel annoyed at the indiscreet
question. And she answered, very softly, almost inaudibly—
</p>
<p>“I—I shall accept.”
</p>
<p>She sighed, and the tears rose in her eyes, when for the first time she made that
resolution. She would accept. And she could find nothing more to say to the old lady;
that one word filled her mind so completely, that it absorbed every other thought.
For a moment, therefore, they sat next each other in silence, a little turned away
from the joyous group round the cards. And Eline could hear Ange’s shrill, laughing
voice, as she laid down the cards, one by one, on the table.
</p>
<p>“Now just listen, Mr. Erlevoort. I am much cleverer than Madame Lenormand. Here is
yours, king of diamonds. You are surrounded by much tears, but they are turned into
smiles; you will have much money, and will go and live in a château in the Pyrenees.
Or would you rather buy a villa near Nice? Ah, there she is! queen of hearts, you
see. You are rather wide apart, but all the intermediate cards are favourable. You
will have to struggle against many obstacles before you can reach her, for she is
rather sought after, you see; but—the king of clubs, king of diamonds, a plebeian
even, a social democrat; knave of spades!”
</p>
<p>“Black Jack!” cried Léonie. “Ah, <i lang="fr">fi donc</i>!”
</p>
<p>Eline smiled, a little frightened, and wiped away a tear from her lashes; and Madame
van Raat, who had also been listening, smiled too.
</p>
<p>“There, just see how beautiful those aces lie,” Ange went on. “No fear, Mr. Erlevoort,
no fear; ’tis all clearing up nicely.”
</p>
<p>“The cards seem favourable,” whispered Madame van Raat.
</p>
<p>Eline gave a little smile of contempt, but she felt a little upset; Black Jack had
reminded her of Fabrice.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The company had risen from the whist-table, and the conversation became lively and
general. The fortune-telling had given an impetus to the gaiety all round, and Etienne
was loud in his protestations to Ange, who prophesied that he would be an old bachelor.
Not he; he declined with thanks.
</p>
<p>Ange and Léonie persuaded Paul to sing something else, and Léonie accompanied him
in one of Massenet’s songs. In the <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>meantime Betsy looked attentively at her sister and Otto, and thought she could see
that nothing had yet transpired between them. How Eline did dilly-dally, to be sure!
No; she had managed it better herself. She had quietly accepted van Raat when he in
his clumsiness had proposed to her. What was Eline thinking about? why in Heaven’s
name shouldn’t she accept Erlevoort? They were quite cut out for one another. And
she worried herself about that sentimental hesitation on the part of her sister, when
she had the chance of marrying into a good family, and a man in a fair position. Her
eye glanced coldly on Eline’s slender form, to which that hesitating coyness lent
an additional charm, and she remarked it, as she also remarked the unwonted earnestness
that seemed to be diffused over her beauty. What a lot of to-do about such a simple
matter! But when she caught sight of her husband, who was talking to Otto, she felt
even more annoyed; how stupid he was, to be sure! Had he really no notion as yet why
Otto was there that evening?
</p>
<p>Madame van Raat left later than she usually did, still feeling uncertain in her mind
about Eline’s decision. She had to some extent anticipated a sort of family evening,
and she felt decidedly disappointed.
</p>
<p>It was now long past twelve, and Madame Eekhof and her daughters, together with Emilie,
Vincent, and Paul, prepared to go, the girls, amid much laughing banter, being conducted
by Henk and Etienne through the hall to their carriage. Betsy, Eline, and Otto remained
behind in the little boudoir, and the silence somewhat embarrassed them. But Betsy
purposely rose and walked into the drawing-room towards the card-table, as though
to gather up the scattered counters. To Eline it seemed as if the ground was giving
way under her. She could not hide her confusion from Otto’s eyes, and he, although
he had had no intention that evening of reverting to his request, did not feel himself
strong enough to resist the temptation of the moment, now that they were alone together.
</p>
<p>“Eline,” he whispered, in a broken voice; “oh, must I leave you like this?”
</p>
<p>Almost in terror she gasped forth her pent-up breath in a trembling sigh.
</p>
<p>“Otto—really, truly—I—I cannot, not yet.”
</p>
<p>“Adieu then; forgive me, pray, for having worried you a second <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>time,” he said, and with that he lightly pressed her fingers and went.
</p>
<p>As for her, however, she felt herself suddenly relenting into a melting tenderness.
Trembling and shaking all over, she all but fell to the floor, but she saved herself
by rushing towards the door, where she clung to the heavy draperies, and altogether
yielding herself up to her emotions, she cried—
</p>
<p>“Otto! Otto!”
</p>
<p>He could not repress a light cry. He quickly turned back and caught her in his arms,
and with his face all aglow with pleasure he led her back into the boudoir.
</p>
<p>“Eline, Eline!” he cried: “is it true?”
</p>
<p>She made no reply, but flung herself sobbing on his bosom, her spirit utterly broken
with her inward struggles.
</p>
<p>“You will—you will be my little wife, then?”
</p>
<p>She just ventured to lift up her face, whilst she lay trembling in his arms, her only
reply being her tearful glance and her faint smile.
</p>
<p>“Oh—Eline—my darling!” he whispered, and his lips pressed her forehead.
</p>
<p>Voices were heard in the drawing-room. Henk and Etienne were coming out of the hall,
Etienne carrying his overcoat and hat in his hand.
</p>
<p>“But where is Otto all this time?” Eline heard him exclaim, and she could at the same
time distinguish Betsy’s voice, who whispered something.
</p>
<p>Otto looked smilingly down upon the little weeping head, which, suddenly alarmed,
was pressed against his bosom.
</p>
<p>“Come, shall we go, then?” he asked, and in his simplicity he beamed with joy.
</p>
<p>Slowly, very slowly, she let him lead her away, still sobbing in his arms, her head
hid on his shoulder. Betsy met them with a laugh, and pressed Otto’s hand with a significant
glance. Henk and Etienne were somewhat surprised.
</p>
<p>“Van Raat, may I—may I introduce you to my intended?” said Otto.
</p>
<p>It was Henk’s turn to smile now, and Etienne’s, who opened his eyes wide with amazement.
</p>
<p>“There’s a sly old customer!” he cried, and held his finger up threateningly. “Who
would have expected that this evening, now? what do you think of that?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>Eline, however, still sobbing, relieved herself of Otto’s arm, and clasped Henk round
his neck. He kissed her, and his big voice muttered kindly—
</p>
<p>“Well, I will congratulate you, sissy, with all my heart. But the deuce! come, don’t
cry like that—what’s the idea of that now? Come, give us a laugh now, for a change.”
</p>
<p>In confusion she covered her face with her hands, and now Betsy thought that it was
her turn to give her a kiss, and she just touched the dishevelled little locks.
</p>
<p>“I am very satisfied with my little <i lang="fr">soirée</i>, very satisfied!” she said significantly.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Henk wanted Otto to stay a little longer, Etienne was discreet enough to take himself
off, but Eline whispered beseechingly that she was very tired, and Otto did not insist.
He was too happy to wish for anything more; he would go, brimful of joy. And she thought
it very nice of him that he took leave only with a shake of the hand, as she feared
he would have kissed her before all of them.
</p>
<p>The two brothers left, and Eline fled to her room, where she found Mina, who was just
lighting the lamp. The servant-maids had heard the news from Gerard, who had come
into the drawing-room at a very inopportune moment, and Mina congratulated her, and
looked at her with an inquisitive smile about her lips.
</p>
<p>“Thank you—thank you, Mina,” stammered Eline.
</p>
<p>At last she was alone. She glanced in the mirror, and she started when she saw the
tearful pallor of her face. Yet it seemed to her as though her soul glided away in
a still, blue lake, that noiselessly covered her with its waters, a spot where an
eternal peace seemed to reign, a Nirvana, the calm rapture of which was to her a new
happiness.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was a fresh, bright May day, after a week of rain and chill mists. Jeanne had sent
her children—Dora, Wim, and Fritsje—for a walk with their nurse, to the Schevening
Boschjes. She herself, however, had stayed at home, as she was always much occupied,
and she felt lonely in her apartments, sitting there by herself, doing her knitting
and darning in a pale sunbeam which she, regardless of her carpet and her curtains,
allowed to stream freely into the room. Frans was away in Amsterdam, where he had
gone to consult a physician. It was now half-past one, thought Jeanne, as she glanced
at the timepiece, the tick of which was heard very distinctly in the quiet room. About
half-past five Frans would return, and the time which she had yet to wait seemed so
many ages to her, although she thought it splendid for once to be able to do such
a lot of work undisturbed.
</p>
<p>The pale sunbeam fell right over her, but it did not trouble her; on the contrary
she basked in its faint warmth. The light shimmered about her light-brown hair, and
imparted to her sunken white cheeks an alabaster transparency; it shimmered too over
her thin, delicate fingers, as with a steady, rhythmical motion she plied her needle.
And how she longed for the summer! oh, that May, with its damp misty weather and its
rare bright days, might soon be passed! how could she have cherished any illusion
of May being a month of spring beauty, as the poets falsely said?
</p>
<p>She smiled a little sadly as she bent over the chemisette she was making, to press
down a seam with her fingers; she smiled when she reflected that every illusion, the
smallest even, vanished into air, while her life rolled on, and the future, which
she feared with a great, mysterious, unspeakable terror, continually faded away, to
make room for that gloomy, monotonous reality. And now—now she shuddered, now once
more that fearful presentiment rose up in her soul, like a veiled spectre; something
would happen to them, some inevitable disaster would crush them. She took a deep breath,
shuddering, her hand pressed on her bosom; shuddering, not for herself, not for him—but
for the children.
</p>
<p>She rose, it was impossible for her to continue her work, and yet she must not be
idle on the rare day when the children left her undisturbed. Oh, why was she not stronger?
And leaning <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>against the window-sill she let herself be entirely covered by the ray of sunshine,
like a pale hot-house flower longing for light and air, and she gazed, absorbed in
her thoughts of what was to be, into the little square patch of garden behind the
grocery shop below. A lilac was just budding into leaf, but in the centre or side
beds nothing as yet was growing, and before Jeanne’s eyes there suddenly arose a vision
of Persian roses, such as those that bloomed on their property at Temanggoeng, big,
like pink beakers, full of sweet odour. It was as though she smelt that odour; it
was as though the blushing tint of those flowers dispelled the dull gray thoughts,
and left in their place merely a longing for warmth and love.
</p>
<p>Thus she felt when the bell rang, and Mathilde van Ryssel entered. They had met each
other once or twice at the van Raats’, and they were aware of a certain sympathy between
them.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“I have really come with the evil intention of tempting you out for a walk,” said
Mathilde smiling. “It is glorious weather, and it will do you good.”
</p>
<p>“But, Tilly, the children are out, and Frans as well. Really I can’t, I have work
to do.”
</p>
<p>“What insurmountable objects, to be sure!” laughed Mathilde. “You need not take care
of the house.”
</p>
<p>“No; but when the children come home, and find me out——”
</p>
<p>“Really, Jeanne, that is spoiling them; surely they can manage to do without you for
a moment. I should get my hat and jacket, if I were you, and come out with me like
a sensible girl. What! sewing, are you? That’s work for a rainy day.”
</p>
<p>Jeanne felt a gentle delight at having the law laid her by that soft voice, which
even in its banter was pervaded with a tone of sadness. And she yielded, feeling so
happy, and ascended the stairs to dress, almost humming the while.
</p>
<p>She was soon ready, and after numberless admonitions to Mietje, left the house with
Mathilde. The cool wind seemed to lift a mist from her mind, while her pale checks
became cold and almost got a colour. She listened to her friend, who told her that
she had just taken Tina and Jo to the van Raats’; Betsy and Eline had asked them to
go for a walk with them and Ben.
</p>
<p>“And the others?”
</p>
<p>“Oh! Lientje and Nico had absolutely to go out with mamma; <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>mamma was already in despair that she could not have the other two. I should not have
dared to take them with me,” she said laughing. “Dear, kind mamma!”
</p>
<p>They had passed through the Laan van Meerdervoort and reached the Schevening road,
which they followed. There were but few people about. Mathilde let herself be carried
away by her feelings, and revived by the clear, fresh air, little talkative though
she might be generally in her reserve, and her silent grief.
</p>
<p>“You don’t know how—how good mamma is,” she said. “She lives only for her dear ones—for
her children and her grandchildren. She never has the slightest want of her own; whatever
she thinks or does, ’tis all for us. And I believe if you asked her which of us she
liked best, she could not tell you. Yes; she is mad with Etienne; Etienne is always
jolly, like a child, and because she too is cheerful and likes a good laugh, his jokes
do her good; but that she cares equally for Frédérique or Otto, or for my children,
I have no doubt. When mamma writes to London, or Zwolle, or to the Horze, it is one
long complaint that she never sees those stray sheep. You can understand how unhappy
she was when Cathérine and Suzanne married and left her. I believe she would like
to build a sort of hotel, where she could stow the lot of us—Théodore and Howard and
Stralenburg, and all the rest. Dear, dear mamma!”
</p>
<p>They both were silent for a time. The Schevening road twisted itself like a long gray
ribbon before them, with a distant perspective of tree stems under a network of budding
twigs. The sunshine glistened on the fresh young foliage waving bright under the clear
blue sky, and on the old stems there appeared a new layer of fresh green moss, soft
as velvet. The chirping of birds vibrated through the clear atmosphere in tones of
crystal.
</p>
<p>“How glorious it is here!” said Mathilde; “one lives anew. But let us get into this
little lane. The people tire me; I dare say we tire them too; we are out of harmony
with nature’s surroundings. I always think people so ugly amid green foliage, especially
in the early spring. You see, I am beginning to philosophize.”
</p>
<p>Jeanne laughed, brimful of happiness. The world appeared to her beautiful and good,
full of love. And she thought of Frans!
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>They had seated themselves on a bench, and Jeanne ventured to ask—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>“But how about yourself, Mathilde? You are always talking about your mamma, but never
about yourself.”
</p>
<p>Mathilde looked up with something like a shiver.
</p>
<p>“About myself? I do my best to forget about myself. ’Tis only to the children that
I am still of any use; for them I live and think. If they were not here, I should
be dead.”
</p>
<p>In her words there resounded the memory of a dull grief, faded away long ago into
a placid resignation.
</p>
<p>“If you have imagined yourself very happy, happy through and with one, for whose sake
you would have sacrificed body and soul, and you observe—But ah! why speak about that?”
</p>
<p>“Does the thought of that cause you such suffering then?”
</p>
<p>“Oh no; I have suffered. There was a time when I thought I should have gone mad, and
I cursed the name of God; but that bitter sorrow has been transformed into a lethargy
that is past. I never think of it, I only think of my four little darlings. And that
thought fills my mind sufficiently, so that I need not become a living mummy. You
know, until now I have been teaching them myself; but ’tis getting time for Tina and
Jo to go to school. Otto says so at least; but I should miss them very much, and mamma,
of course, sides with me there. Darlings!”
</p>
<p>Perhaps she only fancied it, but Jeanne thought that in that dull resignation she
could detect a tone of suppressed bitterness, and she could not help taking Mathilde’s
hand in hers and whispering pityingly—
</p>
<p>“Poor girl!”
</p>
<p>“Yes; you—you are richer than I, you have your children and you have your husband,”
answered Mathilde with a sad smile, whilst her eyes filled with tears; “and though
you have your troubles and vexations, you have more—more than I. Let that be your
comfort when you have a fit of melancholy. Just think of me, think that I could yet
envy you, if—if everything were not dead within me, everything except that one thing
alone.”
</p>
<p>“Mathilde! Oh, how can you speak like that? it pains me!”
</p>
<p>“It should not do so, for me it pains no longer. ’Tis only just a faint memory of
what has been, you know; nothing more. But still, ’tis better to be silent about it;
the raking up of these memories does me no good, but hurts me, though I am almost
a mummy.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, Mathilde, how is it possible that you can always keep it <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>pent up within you? I—I could not do so; I should have to give it vent, that which
made me so——”
</p>
<p>“No, no, Jeanne; oh, truly no, never more! Do not speak any more about it, or—I—I
shall feel myself brought back to life again. No, don’t; never again—I beg of you.”
</p>
<p>She leaned back against the seat, and tears dropped from her lashes, whilst with her
waxen pallor, and in her sombre black dress, she seemed a picture of an infinite,
unspeakable sorrow. She would not be brought back to life, she wanted to be dead!
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Jeanne did not want to get home too late, so that she might be there before the children
and Frans. So they turned back.
</p>
<p>“And now I dare say I have made you sad, when I wanted to refresh you with a pleasant
walk?” asked Mathilde smiling. “Yes; that comes of all that philosophy; forgive me,
do!”
</p>
<p>Jeanne could find nothing to say, and shook her head smilingly, to signify that she
was really not sad. And in her inmost soul she had to acknowledge deeply—though Mathilde’s
silent despair had at first grieved her—now that she herself had once more assumed
her ordinary semblance of resignation, that pity for her friend became fused into
a feeling of peace and rest, as far as her own small troubles were concerned. By the
side of that one great ever-reviving sorrow the latter seemed to her small and insignificant,
the easily-borne troubles of life, whilst had she been doomed to bear Mathilde’s sorrows,
she would have been crushed beneath them. She felt a remorse that she was ungrateful
for all the good that was bestowed on her, and which still was hers—a remorse that
sometimes she dared to feel herself wretched at her fate, and yet she had been spared
so much sorrow! Frans, he might have his faults, he might be hasty and disagreeable
when he was ill; still he loved her, a and after a moment’s reflection, he was always
ready to own himself in the wrong; still he prized her. And in that sweet thought,
which made her feel proudly contented, she could no longer feel sad in sympathy, though
she considered herself an egotist on account of it; but oh! it was so rarely that
she felt such a delicious sweetness pervade her little soul; was it wrong then for
a brief moment to feel an egotist’s pleasure?
</p>
<p>Mathilde took her home again, and Jeanne left to herself longed, full of renewed animation,
for her children. Soon they came, refreshed with their bout in the open, and she embraced
them <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>almost impetuously, and let them tell her where they had been, what they had done.
And when Dora was a little peevish, she joked and played with the little weakling
until she laughed. Life did not seem quite so sombre now; why not be a bit cheerful?

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Lili sat reading in the small drawing-room, when Frédérique entered. She had been
paying some visits and came to finish her afternoon at the Verstraetens’.
</p>
<p>“Is Marie out?” asked Freddie.
</p>
<p>“No,” answered Lili; “we have been out. Marie is still up-stairs.”
</p>
<p>“What is Marie doing there?” resumed Frédérique, in some surprise. “What in Heaven’s
name is she always doing up-stairs lately? Whenever I come here, she is up-stairs.
You haven’t fallen out, have you?”
</p>
<p>“Oh no; not at all,” replied Lili. “Marie is doing some drawing, I believe; or perhaps
she has some writing to do, as she often has.”
</p>
<p>“Writing what—a letter?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, no—a novel, or something of the sort; but you had better not say anything about
it; perhaps she does not like us to know.”
</p>
<p>Frédérique was silent for a moment.
</p>
<p>“Don’t you find Marie rather changed?” she resumed.
</p>
<p>“Changed? Marie? No; I have noticed nothing. Why do you ask?”
</p>
<p>“Oh! for no special reason; I was only thinking. Marie is always so busy just now,
with one thing or another.”
</p>
<p>“But so she has always been; she always tries to find something to do. Papa says I
am the only lazy one in the family.”
</p>
<p>Frédérique was silent; but inwardly she wondered that Lili had not remarked how lately
there was something unusual about Marie, something excitable and nervous, so very
different from her former healthy cheerfulness. However, she thought, perhaps it was
only her fancy after all.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>“You know we are going to the Oudendyks’ this evening,” she said, to turn the conversation.
</p>
<p>“Oh yes; you told me some time ago that you were invited. So you are going out again,
eh? You have been a little blasé for a time, haven’t you? at least you were always
taken ill after an invitation,” laughed Lili.
</p>
<p>“Oh, I felt very ill at ease,” Frédérique answered frankly. “It was, you know, on
account of that folly of Otto’s. But now that there is nothing more to do in the affair,
I wash my hands of it. He ought to know best, eh? Anyhow, I don’t see the use of fretting
because——”
</p>
<p>She did not finish the sentence, and her eyes became moist, as an expression of haughty
disdain formed about her mouth.
</p>
<p>“But, Freddie,” Lili gently remonstrated, “he has known her so long; all the time
she has been living at the van Raats’; and if he really cares for her——”
</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s nothing I should desire more, than that all may go well, and they may
be happy. But I can’t help it. Eline I cannot bear. Of course now I force myself to
be nice and friendly to her; but you know it is so difficult for me to make myself
appear different from what I am. But come, let us talk about something else; it can’t
be helped now, and the less I think of it the better. Shall we go up-stairs to Marie?”
</p>
<p>Lili agreed, and they went. In the girls’ sitting-room Marie was seated at a little
writing-table; a few sheets of writing lay before her, but her head was resting on
her hand, and with her pen she was, as if lost in thought, drawing some strokes across
a blank sheet of paper. When Freddie and Lili entered, she gave a sudden start.
</p>
<p>“We have come to disturb you in your busy occupations,” commenced Freddie, laughing;
“that is, unless you would rather have us go.”
</p>
<p>“Certainly not; you know better, don’t you? So unsociable too of Lili, to sit down
all by herself, down-stairs.”
</p>
<p>Lili did not answer; neither of them was in the habit of staying in her room in the
afternoon, and it was Marie herself who was unsociable.
</p>
<p>“What is it you are writing? is it a secret?” asked Freddie, with a glance at the
scribbled sheets.
</p>
<p>“Oh no,” answered Marie, with seeming indifference. “’Tis <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>something I started long ago—a sort of diary, a description of our trip in Thuringia
and the Black Forest last year. I wanted to make up a little sketch about it, something
romantic if possible, but ’tis getting tiresome. I really don’t know what made me
start it,” she added softly; “I’m not cut out for writing, eh?”
</p>
<p>“I can’t say,” said Freddie encouragingly. “Just read us a little of it.”
</p>
<p>“Yes; fancy boring you with my school-girl scribble. <i lang="fr">Pas si bête</i>,” cried Marie laughing. “You see, a person must do something; I felt bored, so I
started writing. I’ll tell you what it is, Frédérique,” she continued, with a tragic-comic
glance at her friend, “I think we are growing so old. Yes, downright old; we are getting
tiresome. Do you know, ’tis months since we had a good laugh together, as we used
to so often.”
</p>
<p>“With Paul or Etienne?” added Lili, smiling at the recollection.
</p>
<p>“With or without them. We used to amuse ourselves without the boys just as well. But
now—I don’t know what you think, but I think we are all of us awful bores. We are
each of us getting our worries—<i>you</i> have for some time suffered from an antipathy towards Eline. Lili does not speak
a word; she is either in dreamland all day, or overwhelms me with her romantic musings;
and as for myself, out of sheer <i>ennui</i> I start writing about blue mountains and misty horizons.”
</p>
<p>“What will it all end in?” laughed Freddie. “The future looks very dismal, especially
in your case. Behind those blue mountains and the misty horizon there is something
hidden, I know.”
</p>
<p>“Something hidden?” repeated Marie. “Oh no, not at all; nothing.”
</p>
<p>Frédérique fancied she could see a tear glide through Marie’s fingers, which she held
in front of her eyes. Lili kept herself occupied arranging a few books in a bookcase.
</p>
<p>“Marie,” whispered Freddie softly, “come, tell me. Is anything the matter? can I do
anything for you? I wish you would tell me if there is. I can see there is something
that troubles you.”
</p>
<p>Marie rose, and turned her face away.
</p>
<p>“Oh dear, no, Freddie; don’t you fancy anything of the sort. You are getting just
as romantic as Lili. There is nothing, really. ’Tis only that I feel wretchedly bored,
that is all; I want some cheerfulness. Hallo, old chappie!”
</p>
<p>Her brother entered, somewhat surprised.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Eh! what are you three doing here? Talking about your gentleman friends, I’ll bet!”
he cried noisily.
</p>
<p>“What a wise remark,” answered Marie. “Just like the men. ’Tis your natural vanity
that makes you say such a thing, though you are but a boy yourself. Wait a bit, I’ll
teach you.”
</p>
<p>She ran after him round the table, whilst he, mocking her, deftly skipped over a chair,
which he quickly placed in her way. Freddie and Lili roared with laughter at their
antics. All at once he rushed out of the room, and Marie after him.
</p>
<p>“What a girl that Marie is!” cried Freddie wonderingly. It passed her understanding.
After a while Marie returned, all out of breath.
</p>
<p>“Did you catch him?” asked Lili.
</p>
<p>“Of course not,” she answered. “That boy is like a goat, so nimble, he skips over
everything. Ah, ’tis a treat, a run like that. I wish I were a boy.”
</p>
<p>Freddie left, and Lili accompanied her down-stairs; Marie was coming down directly.
But she stayed at the window for a while, and looked out. In the falling twilight,
which was wrapping everything in a transparent ashen-hued mist, lay the canal, green
and still, overshadowed by the leafy boughs of the bordering trees. Beyond it lay
the Maliebaan, dim in the gathering shadows, with a moist thin veil of grayish dew
rising upward from its surface.
</p>
<p>Marie looked out and sighed. Yes; she would always laugh away that feeling, that cruel,
gnawing bitterness, out of her heart, as she had done just now. She was growing old,
downright old, and tiresome. Without mercy for herself she would wrench away that
blossom from her soul, she would again and again blot out that vision. It was torture,
but still she must do it.
</p>
<p>And as she stared away into that melancholy mist, ascending in gray layers over the
valley yonder, a beloved face rose up before her moist eyes—a manly face, with an
expression of frankness and sincerity in its eyes, and beaming with a winning smile;
but it was not upon her, but upon Eline, that that smile threw its brightness.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The tramcars running between the Ouden Schevening road and the Kurhaus were thronged.
At the junction of the Anna Paulownastraat and the Laan Copes van Cattenburgh they
were stormed by waiting crowds, and in a moment they were filled to overflowing—inside,
outside, and on the platforms. There was a vast amount <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>of pushing to obtain even the merest standing-room, among the numbers of ladies, who,
nervous and excited, fluttered about in their gay toilets, peering through the windows
in the hope of finding a vacant spot. The conductors pulled the bells, and shouted
to those who were left behind, who turned away and began to watch for the next car
to arrive. The horses started, and the faces of those who had managed to wedge their
way in, and were seated packed close as herrings, now beamed with happiness after
the successful struggle.
</p>
<p>“What a crowd! It’s fearful,” said Eline, looking down upon the surging mass with
a placid smile.
</p>
<p>She sat beside Betsy in the open landau, with Henk and Otto facing her. Dirk, the
coachman, had been compelled to halt a moment, but now again the long file of carriages
began to move. Herman, the little footman, sat on the box with crossed arms, motionless
and straight in his light gray livery with its bright buttons.
</p>
<p>“There will be a terrible crowd,” said Betsy. “But it’s in the open air, so we need
not fear we shall get no seat.”
</p>
<p>Not a breath of wind stirred through the dense foliage, and after a day of intense
heat and glaring sun, with the gathering twilight a leaden heaviness seemed to descend
over everything. Eline, rather faint with the heat, leaned back with pale cheeks and
spoke little; only now and then glancing at Otto through her drooping lashes, with
an archness that was full of happiness. Betsy kept up a lively conversation with van
Erlevoort, for Henk was not very talkative either, reflecting as he was whether it
would not have been wiser to have stayed at home drinking a cup of tea in the garden,
rather than rush away directly after dinner to Scheveningen.
</p>
<p>Betsy, however, robust and cheerful, enjoyed the fragrant air, of which she took deep
breaths. She enjoyed the soft, padded cushions of her luxurious, well-appointed carriage,
contrasting so brightly with the other vehicles; she enjoyed even the sight of Herman’s
dignified attitude, and of the silver initials worked on the hangings of the box.
She was contented with herself, with the luxury that she displayed, and contented
with her company. Eline was so charmingly pretty, just like a little doll; her dress
of light gray <i lang="fr">étamine</i> was almost striking in its simplicity, while the coquettish little hat enclosed her
face in a framework of silk. Erlevoort was <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>such a fine-looking fellow, and so <i lang="fr">distingué</i>; Henk looked so comfortable and stout, so well-fed—her husband was really not so
bad; she might have fared worse. And she nodded to her acquaintances as their carriage
passed by with her most captivating smile; no, she must not seem proud, though her
fine bay mares ran never so fast.
</p>
<p>“Oh, glorious! the air is getting fresher, I am beginning to revive!” murmured Eline,
raising herself up, with a deep breath, when they had passed the Promenade. “I feel
I want some fresh air, after the temperature of this afternoon.”
</p>
<p>“Come, child, it was delicious!” declared Betsy. “The sort of weather I should always
like to have.”
</p>
<p>“Well, all I can say is, I should be dead after a month of it. I say, Otto, you are
laughing; tell me honestly now—do you think it’s affectation, or do you really believe
that I cannot bear such heat?”
</p>
<p>“Of course I believe you, Elly.”
</p>
<p>She looked at him with feigned anger, and shook her little head reproachfully.
</p>
<p>“Elly again,” she whispered.
</p>
<p>“Oh yes; how stupid of me. Well, I do believe I know something!” he whispered back
delightedly.
</p>
<p>“What are you two planning together?” asked Henk, with curiosity.
</p>
<p>“Nothing at all; eh, Otto? A little secret between us; hush!” and she held her finger
to her mouth, enjoying their mystification.
</p>
<p>The fact was she did not wish Otto to call her by the familiar diminutive every one
else gave her. She wanted him to invent one for himself alone, one that was not worn
and stale, something new and fresh. He did not think it very childish of her, eh?
And he had exhausted himself trying to think of one, but whatever he said she was
not satisfied; he had better try again. Well, had he found something at last?
</p>
<p>“I am really anxious to know what it is,” she whispered once more, smiling.
</p>
<p>“Afterwards,” he whispered back, and then both smiled.
</p>
<p>“Look here, until now I have found you less tiresome than most engaged couples, so
don’t you, too, start these intolerable inanities,” cried Betsy indignantly, but without
much anger.
</p>
<p>“Well; and how about you and Henk then, at one time!” laughed Eline. “Eh, Henk?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Ah, I should think so!” answered Henk laughing, whilst she, at the thought of her
sister’s betrothal, now years ago, felt a faint recollection of her feelings in those
days rise to her mind, like something very far away and strange.
</p>
<p>But they had long passed by the villas along the Badhuis road, and by the Galeries
at the rear of the Kurhaus, and they drew up at the steps of the terrace, by the sea.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The Eekhofs and the Hydrechts were seated at a little table close to the band-stand,
when Betsy, Eline, Otto, and Henk passed one by one through the turnstile. They never
saw them, however, and walked on, Otto’s hand resting on Eline’s arm.
</p>
<p>“Look, there are the van Raats, and Miss Vere, with Erlevoort!” said young Hydrecht.
“They are here every evening lately.”
</p>
<p>“How ridiculously plain Eline dresses just now!” remarked Léonie. “What is the meaning
of that, I wonder? Nothing but affectation. And just fancy—a bonnet and veil! Every
engaged girl thinks she must wear a bonnet and veil. Ridiculous!”
</p>
<p>“But they are a nice pair,” said Madame Eekhof. “There are less suitable matches.”
</p>
<p>“Anyhow, they walk decently,” said Ange. “Sometimes those engaged couples make themselves
ridiculous—Marguerite van Laren, for instance, who is always brushing the dust off
her intended’s coat.”
</p>
<p>Betsy meanwhile, bowing and smiling right and left, thought they had better not walk
about any more, but look for a table somewhere.
</p>
<p>Fortunately it was pleasant everywhere; it was even desirable to sit at some distance
from the band-stand, otherwise the noise would have been too great. So they sat down
at a little distance, at the side of the Conversatie-zaal, where there were still
several tables unoccupied, but from where they could see and be seen.
</p>
<p>It was a constant interchange of nods and smiles, and Betsy and Eline now and again
whispered amusedly when they caught sight of some absurd toilette or ridiculous hat.
Eline herself was very satisfied at the simplicity with which, ever since her engagement,
she had dressed herself; a simplicity which, elegant though it still was, was in too
great contrast with her former luxurious toilettes not to be much remarked. That simplicity,
she thought, brought out her captivating beauty in a sort of plastic relief, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>modelled her slender form as though it were a marble statue. In her eyes it veiled
her former frivolousness as with a film of graceful seriousness, a seriousness which
to Otto, with his native simplicity, must be most attractive.
</p>
<p>She could not help being as she was; she felt it difficult to be nothing but herself;
but, on the other hand, it was easy for her to imagine herself playing one or another
part: this time it was that of the somewhat affected but ever-charming and happy <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> of a manly young fellow, one of her own circle, who was liked everywhere for his
unaffected pleasantness. Yes; she was happy—she felt it, with all the delight of a
satisfied longing in her heart, which had so long craved for happiness; she was happy
in the peace and calm which his great, silent love—which she guessed at rather than
understood—had given her; she was happy in the blue stillness of that limpid lake,
that Nirvana into which her fantasy-burdened soul had glided as into a bed of down.
So happy was she, even to her very nerves, which were as loosened chords after their
long-continued tension, that often she felt a tear of intense gratefulness rise to
her eye. The stream of people passed by her incessantly, and began to whirl a little
before her eyes, so that once or twice she did not return their greetings.
</p>
<p>“Eline, why don’t you bow? Can’t you see Madame van der Stoor and little Cateau?”
whispered Betsy reproachingly.
</p>
<p>Eline looked round, and gave her friendliest nod, when Vincent Vere and Paul van Raat
approached them. They remained standing, as there were no vacant chairs to be seen.
</p>
<p>“Would you two like to sit down for a moment; that is, if Eline cares to walk?” asked
Otto, half rising.
</p>
<p>Eline thought it was a capital idea, and whilst Vincent and Paul took their seats,
she and Otto slowly followed the stream of promenaders. They approached the band-stand,
and the high violin movements in the overture to <i>Lohengrin</i> were swelling out fuller and fuller, like rays of crystal.
</p>
<p>A group of attentive music-lovers was ranged about the band in a semi-circle. Otto
wanted to let Eline pass through the narrow gangway between the rows of chairs and
the standing group, but she turned round, and whispered—
</p>
<p>“Listen for a moment; shall we?”
</p>
<p>He nodded his head, and they stood still. How she enjoyed the stately swell of melody.
It seemed to her as though it were not <span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>notes of music, but the blue waters of her lake that flowed by, limpid and clear as
the stream along whose bosom Lohengrin’s bark had glided, and she beheld the swans,
stately and beautiful.
</p>
<p>At the loud <i lang="it">fortissimo</i> she took a deep breath, and while the brittle threads of harmony brought forth by
the violins spun themselves out, thinner and thinner in texture, the swans, stately
and beautiful, also floated away.
</p>
<p>The applause resounded on all sides; the semi-circle broke.
</p>
<p>“Beautiful—oh, how beautiful!” murmured Eline as in a dream. And delightedly she felt
Otto’s hand searching for her arm; life was sweet indeed!
</p>
<p>“Don’t you think it foolish? I always feel myself so—so much better than at other
times, when I hear beautiful music; it is then that I get a feeling as though I am
not <i>quite</i> unworthy of you,” she lisped at his ear, so that none overheard her. “Perhaps it
is childish, but I really cannot help it.”
</p>
<p>She looked at him smiling, but almost anxiously, in suspense at what he would answer.
She often felt some fear at what he might think of her, as though by one thoughtless
word she might lose him; for she did not yet understand how and why he loved her.
</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t for heaven’s sake place me on such a lofty pedestal,” he answered kindly.
“I feel myself so very commonplace, so little raised above others; you must not put
yourself so far beneath me. You not quite unworthy of me! What puts <i>that</i> idea into your head? Little silly! Shall I tell you something? I really don’t think
that you know yourself.”
</p>
<p>Could he be right? she wondered; did she not know herself? A glad surprise filled
her; she thought she knew herself so well. Maybe there was yet something in her soul
of which she knew nothing, something perhaps from which her love for him flowed? Was
it left for him to disclose to her her own inward nature?
</p>
<p>“Oh, Otto——” she began.
</p>
<p>“What?” he asked softly.
</p>
<p>“Nothing. I like you so much when you say anything about yourself and me,” she murmured,
full of a blissful feeling to which she could give no utterance. His hand gently pressed
her arm, and a tremor passed through her, as they walked on amid the laughing, pushing
throng between the tables, stared at by all who knew them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Look at Erlevoort and Eline there, walking blissfully side by side, <i lang="fr">perdus dans le même rêve</i>. They don’t see us again!” cried Léonie, almost regretfully, as she passed by them
with Hydrecht.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Eline and Otto all at once heard their names softly mentioned. They looked round and
saw Madame Verstraeten with Marie, Lili, and Frédérique seated at a little table.
Georges de Woude had already risen and nodded to them, smiling. They came nearer and
shook hands.
</p>
<p>“Hallo, Freddie!” said Otto, surprised.
</p>
<p>“Madame Verstraeten was kind enough to ask me to come,” she answered, by way of explanation.
“Otto, we have just received a letter from the Horze: they are all quite well, and
they want to be remembered to you. To you too, Eline.”
</p>
<p>“Thanks, very much!” replied Eline cordially, while for a moment she sat down in Georges’
chair beside Madame Verstraeten. Marie had turned very pale, but it was not noticeable
under her white veil.
</p>
<p>“Théodore writes that Suzanne and van Stralenburg, with the baby, are coming to stay
with them next week, and mamma is all excitement about it.”
</p>
<p>“What, was mamma going to the Horze? And Howard is coming here?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; that’s just the dilemma.”
</p>
<p>“Dear old Madame Erlevoort!” said Madame Verstraeten.
</p>
<p>“Percy wrote he was coming towards the latter part of July. Well, van Stralenburg
cannot stay longer than the twentieth, writes Théodore. So you can understand”—and
she forced herself to look kindly at Eline—“you can understand how mamma feels about
it. To journey to Zwolle, that she will not be able to manage; and to leave the Hague
before the twentieth, while Howard and Cathérine are coming—that of course she cannot
do.”
</p>
<p>“But Howard is also going to the Horze later on, is he not?” asked Otto.
</p>
<p>“Yes; but he will want to stay a little in the Hague first, and take advantage of
Scheveningen,” answered Frédérique. “Mamma is thinking of all sorts of plans; she
would be in despair if she did not see her new grandchild this summer, you can understand
that.”
</p>
<p>“Well, then, I shall prevail on mamma to go to Zwolle with me, <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>one of these days; that will be the best way out of it<span class="corr" id="xd31e3155" title="Source: .">,</span>” answered Otto. “The journey to the Horze is still more troublesome.”
</p>
<p>“You might try,” said Frédérique. “That would certainly solve the problem.”
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lili told Madame Verstraeten that she would take a walk round with de Woude,
and the old lady asked Otto to sit down for a moment until they returned.
</p>
<p>“How pretty Eline is, is she not, de Woude?” asked Lili. Since she had been skating
with him she allowed him to call her by her name, and she called him simply de Woude.
“I can’t help remarking it whenever I see her.”
</p>
<p>“Yes; she looks very nice,” answered Georges indifferently.
</p>
<p>“No; I think she is downright pretty,” persisted Lili. “How is it possible that you
don’t think her pretty? What a curious taste you have, to be sure!”
</p>
<p>He laughed gaily, in the enjoyment of a secret thought.
</p>
<p>“I can’t help it—can I?—if she leaves me entirely indifferent; I have another ideal
of beauty. But if you absolutely want me to think her pretty, why then I’ll take another
look.”
</p>
<p>“Oh no, no; I don’t care a bit,” she answered, also laughing; “only all the gentlemen
think her pretty, that’s why I can’t understand that you don’t. And I can’t make out
either why Frédérique does not like her. If I were a man, I should fall madly in love
with her.”
</p>
<p>“And fight a duel with Erlevoort, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>The first part of the programme was at an end, and the throng of promenaders grew
denser. Georges and Lili found themselves hemmed in on all sides, and they could proceed
no farther.
</p>
<p>“’Tis awful,” said Lili. “I don’t see any pleasure in it when there are so many.”
</p>
<p>“Shall we make our way to the sands?” he asked softly.
</p>
<p>“If we can,” said Lili, glad at the idea. “Mamma will not mind, I suppose?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, of course not, under my care,” he said reassuringly, and with evident pride.
</p>
<p>They quickly passed through the turnstile. With a feeling of relief they descended
the steps of the terrace, crossed over the road, and hastened down the broad flight
of steps that led to the sands. Here and there a Scheveninger was strolling along
with a <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>slow, measured, heavy step, keeping time with the swaying of his companion’s thick
mass of petticoats.
</p>
<p>And straight in front of the Kurhaus, bathed in the yellow glow of the gas-light,
the waves were washing with refreshingly cool sound.
</p>
<p>“Ah!” cried Lili, “how much nicer it is here!”
</p>
<p>The sea, calm and unruffled, was flowing on in tints of green, azure, and violet,
here and there capped with glistening white foam all along the beach. In the sky above
myriads of stars sparkled, and the Milky Way seemed like a cloth of pearls in the
midst of the mysterious infinity of faint blue. From out of the sea there seemed to
rise an indefinable murmur, like that produced by a gigantic sea-shell.
</p>
<p>“How beautiful and quiet it is here, after the noise yonder; it’s quite entrancing!”
murmured Lili in ecstasy.
</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered Georges.
</p>
<p>She nearly stumbled over something; thereupon he asked her to take his arm, and she
did so. It seemed to him as though he had very much to say to her, and as though he
would never be able to express himself without appearing ridiculous. She too felt
a delicious longing to open her mind, to speak about the sea and sky which seemed
to her so beautiful; but she felt a little ashamed at the poesy that was in her heart,
which contrasted too drolly with the prosy commonplace circles in which they generally
moved. She feared to appear affected, and she said nothing. They both kept silent
as they slowly walked along, with the roar of the sea in their ears, and with a soft
soothing feeling in their hearts that seemed to them more expressive than words.
</p>
<p>They went slowly on, wrapt in their solitude, with the calm of the sea before them.
And he felt that he must say something.
</p>
<p>“I could go on walking like that with you for ever,” said he, and his bantering tone
somewhat concealed the meaning of his words.
</p>
<p>She laughed; it was only fun after all.
</p>
<p>“Then perhaps I might get tired.”
</p>
<p>“Then I should carry you.”
</p>
<p>“You couldn’t; my weight would crush you.”
</p>
<p>“Do you think so little of my strength then? Come, I’ll just show you.”
</p>
<p>“But, Georges, how dare you? I shall end by getting angry with you, at least if you
don’t beg my pardon at once.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span></p>
<p>“How shall I set about that?” he asked, with mock humility.
</p>
<p>She let him spin out a long rigmarole—
</p>
<p>“I, Georges de Woude van Bergh, humbly apologize to —— for having—” and he repeated
every word, while their echo vibrated pleasingly upon her ear.
</p>
<p>For she was not quite so angry as she wanted to appear. It seemed to her as though
their walk would never end, as if they would continue strolling along that light surging
strand until they should come within sight of a fresh horizon.
</p>
<p>“Come, we must return,” she said suddenly; “we are going too far.”
</p>
<p>They turned back, and were quite frightened when they saw how far away the Kurhaus
lay, bathed in a ruddy glow of light; but to her that alarm suddenly melted into a
tenderness, a soft indifference; what cared she for the others over there? they were
together by the sea.
</p>
<p>“Lili, really we must hurry,” said he laughing, somewhat confused. “Your mother will
wonder where we have got to.”
</p>
<p>This time she felt quite hurt at his hurrying; he could not be sensible, then, of
that tender indifference; he did not feel as she did, that they were together by the
sea, and that all the rest was nothing, nothing!
</p>
<p>“I really cannot trudge at such a pace through the sand,” she said, a little vexed,
and she clung closer to his arm. But he was inexorable; she had better lean on his
support if she could not get along fast enough. He certainly could be surprisingly
obstinate under the veil of his gentle affability.
</p>
<p>“But, Georges, I cannot really, I am tired out!” she panted peevishly, although the
would-be anger in her voice melted away in a coaxing tone. He, however, laughingly
rushed up the broad steps, nearly dragging her after him, with her arm clasped fast
in his own, and really she could not help laughing. It was very funny, certainly,
rushing along in that way in the darkness.
</p>
<p>Somewhat more slowly they ascended the little steps leading to the terrace, and while
Georges was searching for the enclosure tickets, Lili shook the sand from her dress.
</p>
<p>The second part of the programme had commenced, and the band was blaring out the metallic
fanfares of the march in the <i lang="fr">Reine de Saba</i>; a few promenaders were still about, but there was no longer a crowd. They hurried
with apparent indifference, although <span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>Lili’s cheeks were red as fire, to their little table. Madame Verstraeten was seated
alone with Marie and Frédérique; Otto and Eline were gone.
</p>
<p>“Good gracious, where have you two been hiding?” cried Marie, while Georges and Lili
sat down on the chairs, across which a cloak had been thrown to reserve them. “I have
been walking with Paul, and Eline and Otto could not really keep your seats for you
any longer.”
</p>
<p>“We made almost superhuman efforts to reserve them, did we not, madam?” added Frédérique.
</p>
<p>“But where have you been, then?” asked Madame Verstraeten wonderingly. “In the Conversazione
Room, looking at the dancing?”
</p>
<p>Georges told them of their walk by the sea, and Lili inwardly admired him for the
tact with which he replied to her mother’s questioning.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Henk and Vincent were seated by themselves at a table near the Conversazione Room,
while Betsy and young Hydrecht were strolling about in a somewhat too boisterous flirtation,
and Eline and Otto had sat down for a moment next to Madame Eekhof, whom they had
passed by four times without any greeting, as Ange declared.
</p>
<p>“I was nearly dead with this terrible heat to-day,” muttered Vincent.
</p>
<p>“Yes; Eline can’t bear it either,” answered Henk, emptying his glass of Pilsener.
</p>
<p>Vincent drank nothing; he felt rather giddy at the incessant surging round and round
of all these people. He rarely went to Scheveningen; in the morning the heat was unbearable
on the scorching sand, and at night it tired him too much. Once or twice he went,
just for the sake of saying he had been.
</p>
<p>A question to Henk was on his lips, one which he scarcely dared to put—a request for
money. The second time that Henk had advanced him money, he had not done so with his
usual brusque bonhomie. Vere’s eternal impecuniosity was beginning to tire him—it
was always the same tune! This had not escaped Vincent; but still he could not help
it, and he began with an introduction, with an assumed lightness of manner.
</p>
<p>“I think I shall be able to repay you part of my debt this week, <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>van Raat. I am expecting money. Only for the moment I am awfully short. If I had not
taken advantage of your kindness so often already, I would ask your assistance once
more; but I am afraid I’m getting indiscreet now. I shall see and get along just for
this week.”
</p>
<p>Henk did not answer. With his stick he sat slowly beating time to the music.
</p>
<p>“It’s a nuisance that I did not come to an arrangement with that quinine affair,”
resumed Vincent. “But you see I have just received a letter from a friend in America;
he is rich and is well connected, and will get me an introduction to a business house
in New York. But for the moment, you know—I say, van Raat, you would be rendering
me an immense service—lend me another fifty florins.”
</p>
<p>Henk turned round to face Vincent, with a passionate movement.
</p>
<p>“Look here, Vere, is there never going to be an end of that bother? I must frankly
admit that it is beginning to sicken me. One day ’tis fifteen hundred florins, then
a hundred, then fifty. What—what in Heaven’s name are you waiting for then? What is
it you intend to do? why do you laze about so, if you haven’t a cent in the world?
why don’t you try and get something to do? I can’t keep you, can I?”
</p>
<p>Vincent had felt a vague presentiment of a coming storm, and let the curt disjointed
sentences which Henk in his clumsy passion grunted out, pass over him without contradiction.
But his silence made Henk feel almost embarrassed, and the sound of his own voice
reverberated roughly in his ears. Still he proceeded—
</p>
<p>“Then again you talk a lot of nonsense about money from Brussels—or from Malaga; another
time it is to come from New York. When is it coming, I should like to know? You understand,
it won’t ruin me if you don’t pay me what you owe me, neither shall I ever trouble
you about it; but taken altogether it’s now not far short of two thousand florins,
and I am getting sick of it. Don’t in Heaven’s name keep loafing about in the Hague
here; look for something to do.”
</p>
<p>Henk’s passionate tone was already giving way to a kindlier one, but Vincent remained
silent, his eyes fixed on the points of his boots, which he was gently tapping with
his stick, and Henk was at a loss what to say next. And it was a relief to him when
Vincent at length lifted up his head and whispered—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>“It’s quite true—you are right—but it’s not my fault—circumstances. Anyhow I shall
see what I can do—excuse my troubling you.”
</p>
<p>He slowly rose from his seat, while Henk, whom that placid resignation greatly embarrassed,
sought in vain for some appropriate phrase.
</p>
<p>“Well, good-night, <i lang="fr">au revoir</i>!” Vincent said with a faint smile, and he nodded to Henk without offering him his
hand. “Good-night; I must be off.”
</p>
<p>Henk wanted to give him his hand, but Vincent had already turned his back on him,
and Henk saw him slowly picking out his way through the throng, now and then raising
his hat with a languid movement.
</p>
<p>Very dissatisfied with himself, Henk remained seated alone at his table. After a while,
however, Eline and Otto returned and laughingly expressed their sympathy for his loneliness.
Betsy too was soon after brought back by Hydrecht, whose hand she cordially pressed.
It was late; many people had already left before the last number, and now that the
concert was at an end, the crowds slowly moved away through the Kurhaus. Gradually
the noise of the music and laughter-laden atmosphere subsided into a restful calm,
whilst here and there the gas-lamps were already being extinguished, and only a stray
group or two were still sitting down, enjoying the balmy air, which was growing fresher
and purer at every moment.
</p>
<p>“It’s glorious here; shall we sit a little longer?” asked Betsy.
</p>
<p>“Let us rather have a drive round,” said Eline; “at least unless you think it will
be getting too late, and the horses are not tired, Henk.”
</p>
<p>Betsy thought Eline rather eccentric to want to drive so late at night, but still
the idea pleased her. And they walked to the rear of the Kurhaus, where the carriage
was waiting.
</p>
<p>Eline thought the wind had risen, and preferred to sit forward under the half-closed
hood, next to Otto. Betsy told Dirk to drive home through the Van Stolkpark.
</p>
<p>The outlines of the villas looked dim and shadowy between the vague, dark masses of
foliage, through which now and then a gentle gust of wind rustled with a lulling sound.
But the clatter of the horses and the light rumbling of the wheels along the road
<span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>drowned the sighing of the wind with a noise that remained unbroken by words.
</p>
<p>Betsy lay back comfortably, and enjoyed the cool night air. Henk was still under the
uncomfortable influence of his conversation with Vincent, whom he thought he had hurt,
and Eline let her thoughts wander away in a delicious reverie. She had removed her
hat, and she bent a little towards Otto, and listened to his regular breathing. He,
effectually hidden in the shadow of the raised hood, had his arm round her waist,
and had drawn her a little towards him, so that her cheek nearly lay on his shoulder.
And she was very happy, she wished nothing more than thus, in his arm, to be driven
along in the evening breeze, beneath the gently rustling foliage. She could conceive
of nothing sweeter, than thus to lean against him, to feel the passage of his breath
through her hair, and his arm about her waist like a girdle of love.
</p>
<p>And yielding to the delicious influences of the moment, she let her head fall on his
shoulder.
</p>
<p>“What name have you thought of for me?” she whispered in his ear.
</p>
<p>“Nily,” he whispered back, and whilst she felt his arm clasp her waist more closely,
her lips inaudibly repeated the name, the echo of which resounded through her being
like a caress of jubilant love.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Mathilde van Ryssel had taken a tent by the sea, and told Jeanne Ferelyn to come and
sit there with her children as often as she chose. At first, out of diffidence, Jeanne
had only occasionally availed herself of the invitation; but Mathilde was pressing,
and Jeanne now came very frequently. Sometimes they both arranged that they should
start in the morning early, and take some sandwiches—the children could get plenty
of milk to drink at the milk stall; and so they would sit down, both of them under
the awning of the tent, chatting over their work, whilst their children were delving
with their little spades in a big sand-pit in front of them, or were busy along the
beach, constructing the most wonderful aqueducts. And Jeanne fancied that her children
were getting more robust and less peevish, now that they were in company with the
noisy, playful little van Ryssels, and she and Mathilde gazed delightedly at the boisterous
little band. Jeanne especially felt the influence of that frequent intercourse with
Mathilde, in whom she had found a friend who understood her troubles, and who, with
her <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>sad experience and placid resignation, was ever ready to advise and aid her. They
spoke frequently about their children and their domestic affairs, and Jeanne thought
Mathilde, used though she was to the cosiest of surroundings, exceedingly practical
and frugal.
</p>
<p>But those pleasant days by the sunny seaside did not last long, for the Ferelyns had
to leave. They were going to Boppard, where Frans was to undergo the cold-water cure,
and Jeanne racked her brains trying to calculate the probable expenses of the trip.
How could they afford to stay at Boppard perhaps for six weeks, with their three children,
while at the same time they could not give up their rooms in the Hugo de Grootstraat?
</p>
<p>Madame van Erlevoort, with Otto and Eline, who wanted to make the acquaintance of
her <i>fiancé’s</i> relatives, had been to Zwolle for a day or two, and the old lady was in raptures
about the little van Stralenburg, a baby plump and firm as any she had seen, with
such a head of curly dark hair. She was grateful to Otto for having pressed her to
make the journey to Zwolle; to the Horze she went every summer, and the trip to her
country seat was such an ordinary occurrence that she saw no inconvenience in it at
all; but any other removal from her home circle pained her, as though she were tearing
herself away from her dear ones for ever. It was a luxury to her to be back once more
in her roomy house on the Voorhout, with its somewhat faded, old-fashioned furniture,
but full of comfort and ease. Eline thought the van Stralenburgs most charming people:
Suzanne, a darling little mother, not pretty, at times rather careless in her dress,
but so unaffected and genial, so mad with her little boy, that it was a treat to behold
her; her husband, a good-natured, kindly fellow, but thoroughly spoilt by his wife,
who was constantly at his beck and call, and who ran up and down the stairs for him,
in a way that made Eline sometimes roar with laughter. No, she would never be like
that to Otto; he had better be sure of that. But although she thus spoke laughingly
to Otto, at the bottom of her heart she felt it would be bliss indeed thus to devote
oneself entirely to one’s husband, as Suzanne devoted herself to van Stralenburg;
to exist but for him and be his faithful slave.
</p>
<p>And then a charming picture of home life with Otto, of the life that would be hers,
would arise to her imagination, ever active, and ever in want of vivid imagery, which
even in the happiness of <span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>to-day could not refrain from calling into being a yet happier future.
</p>
<p>In this mood, which filled her soul with idylls, she saw in everything but a reflection
of that happiness, and the people with whom she mingled all seemed to her genial and
kindly, never giving themselves up to bitter quarrelling, and living for each other,
without a semblance of egotism. Scenes with Betsy appeared never destined to recur,
now that she answered her sister’s sharp tone in a voice full of gentleness, as though
she was loth to desecrate her happiness by a single discordant sound. A great calm
came over her nerves, and she herself could not refrain from wondering at her equable,
cheerful good-humour, quite undisturbed by the usual periodic attacks of listless
melancholy. No gray and black mists surrounded her; it was as though she breathed
a light atmosphere, full of brilliancy, fragrance, and sparkle.
</p>
<p>For a day or two after his talk with Vincent, Henk felt very ill at ease. In his native
kindliness he did not like to hurt any one’s feelings, and he thought he <i>had</i> wounded Vere’s pride. After all, the poor devil could not help it, that everything
he undertook failed. So Henk had called on Vincent, and four times he wanted to put
the sum he had asked of him in his hands; but Vincent refused to accept it, and instead,
in fact, had repaid Henk a considerable portion of what he owed him. How he had managed
to procure the money remained a puzzle to Henk, as everything else about Vincent was
a puzzle to him. At home, Betsy reproached her husband with his want of tact in dealing
with Vere, and she, in her vague fear of that cousin, in whom she suspected a latent
power, which could at will crush her with all her strength of mind, resolved at any
price to make him forget her husband’s brusquerie. Théodore had invited Eline to come
and stay at the Horze, and she was to go there towards the end of July together with
the Erlevoorts and the Howards, who were just now in the Hague, and remain in Gelderland
all through August. It would therefore, so Betsy thought, be lonely in her big house
on the Nassauplein; the idea of going out of town with Henk did not much fascinate
her; she would rather make a trip to the South at the commencement of the winter,
when Eline should be married; and it was therefore as much from a longing after change,
as from diplomatic cordiality, that she invited Vincent to pitch his tent with them
during Eline’s absence. She made her request with the most <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>charming manner possible. She would miss Eline so terribly, she would be so lonely,
and Vincent could be so sociable, and chat so pleasantly about his wanderings; so
he must not refuse, he would be doing her an immense favour. Vincent was overjoyed
at the request, opening to him as it did a prospect of peace and placid luxury. He
would lead a life of luxury without having to spend a cent, a month long! and a month
of rest seemed to him, in his wretched hand-to-mouth existence, a period of bliss
without end, an eternity of happiness. He therefore accepted Betsy’s invitation with
a secret gladness, outwardly however with a certain condescension, as though wanting
to show that he still felt hurt at Henk’s refusal, and as though he were happy to
give Betsy an opportunity to make up for van Raat’s unfriendliness.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Lili was cross, very cross, her lips trembled, and the tears nearly stood in her eyes.
</p>
<p>“I really don’t see why he cannot be asked,” she answered Marie pettishly. “He is
a regular visitor here.”
</p>
<p>“But, Lili, how can you be so foolish? Mamma asked him once or twice this winter,
and surely we are not quite so intimate with him that we should invite him to accompany
us into the country. When you begin to ask strangers, there is always a sort of constraint.”
</p>
<p>“But he is very sociable.”
</p>
<p>“That’s true. He improves on further acquaintance, I must admit; but still we don’t
know him as we do Paul and Etienne.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, they are nice boys! They do nothing all day long but lounge about from the Witte
to Linke, and from the Bordelaise to the Bodega, and always with that wretched Vere.
We don’t see them at all just now; Paul occasionally condescends to call, and Etienne
has now become quite a myth. Ask Vere, if you like,” she concluded pettishly; “then
you will have the trio complete.”
</p>
<p>Marie shrugged her shoulders.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Now don’t be angry with me, Lili, because mamma won’t ask de Woude. ’Tis not my fault,”
she answered softly.
</p>
<p>“Oh no, not at all! But ’tis always so when I—when I have an idea. It’s always pooh-pooh’d.
I won’t bother about it any more. I don’t care a rap for the whole party.”
</p>
<p>She left the room, with difficulty repressing her tears, while Marie took up her book
with a sigh.
</p>
<p>Madame Verstraeten had gone to sit down beside her husband in the conservatory. She
had overheard something of Lili’s short passionate sentences, and a thought filled
her that brought a reflection of hesitation over her kindly face.
</p>
<p>“What troubles you?” asked the old gentleman.
</p>
<p>“Oh! it is about de Woude,” whispered Madame Verstraeten hesitatingly, so as not to
be understood by Marie. “Lili wants me to ask him for the party, but——”
</p>
<p>“Well, why not? I don’t dislike de Woude, although he is rather foppish. He can be
jolly enough with the girls——”
</p>
<p>“But, Charles, really we must not encourage that. When I see him I am always as polite
as possible to him, but there’s no occasion for us to encourage him, is there? of
what use can that be? Lili is almost a child yet, and gets her head full of fancies;
but what—what can come of this now?”
</p>
<p>“But why must you all at once think they want to marry? For the present it is only
a question of inviting him.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I know; but you never see them when they are together, as I do. I wish
you would come to Scheveningen once or twice.”
</p>
<p>“No, thanks; I’m much obliged to you.”
</p>
<p>“Then you would see for yourself. You can’t get him away from our table. He is discreet
enough not always to accept when I ask him to come and have an ice; but he stays till
we go, and scarcely says a word to any of his acquaintances. With Marie he’ll just
take a little walk, <i lang="fr">pour acquit de conscience</i>, and after that ’tis Lili here, and Lili everywhere. So you understand I don’t see
much good in it.”
</p>
<p>“Do you think then that Lili——?”
</p>
<p>“Of course, without question! Everybody talks about it too, and they know it; but
they don’t care, bless you! I don’t know—I really don’t—what will come of it all,”
said the old lady, and once more that hesitating shadow stole over her face.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Verstraeten sat for a moment in contemplation: then he whispered something to
his wife, and for a long time they talked together in an undertone.
</p>
<p>Marie however could not get along with her reading, so she went up-stairs to Lili.
She found her sobbing, with her little head buried in the pillows.
</p>
<p>“Lili!” she cried softly.
</p>
<p>Lili started when she heard Marie’s voice.
</p>
<p>“Oh, leave me alone, do!” she cried impatiently.
</p>
<p>But Marie took her hands and forced her to look up.
</p>
<p>“Lili, how can you be so foolish?” she said, in her gently penetrating tones. “You
are making yourself miserable about nothing. In this way we won’t be able to get along
at all together, if you sit and brood like that at every word that is said. Lili,
come now.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, do let me alone!”
</p>
<p>“Do you think it so nice, then, to make yourself unhappy, and lie here alone, crying?
Why don’t you speak to me frankly? Isn’t it much better to trust one another, and
be open and straightforward?”
</p>
<p>How gladly would she herself have spoken, and unbosomed herself to Lili or to her
mother! But no, she could not, there were some feelings that were best hidden.
</p>
<p>Lili raised herself a little, and from her tear-stained face she brushed away the
dishevelled hair with her hands.
</p>
<p>“What would you have me say, then? You know all. There is nothing that Georges can
do finds any more favour in mamma’s eyes.”
</p>
<p>“Come, you exaggerate. Both papa and mamma like him very much.”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes; I know. But if it comes to showing him a little courtesy—And you too——”
</p>
<p>“What then?”
</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say he was a stranger, who could not be asked?”
</p>
<p>“If I had known that that would have caused you pain, I should have said something
else. Only I can’t bear to see you agitating yourself about nothing, Lili. Why, you
carry on as though your life were for ever ruined, and all that because mamma thinks
it better not to ask de Woude.”
</p>
<p>“Well, it isn’t very pleasant for me. I have—I have already spoken to him about the
picnic, and—of course he expects to be invited.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>“But why are you so hasty, then? ’Tisn’t very nice for mamma either, when people begin
to talk about you two. Only yesterday Madame Eekhof asked——”
</p>
<p>“What do we care about Madame Eekhof, if we like each other? If you were to trouble
yourself about everybody——”
</p>
<p>An almost mocking smile formed about Marie’s mouth.
</p>
<p>“Yes, Lili,” she answered with an underlying sadness, which however was lost upon
Lili, who heard only the laughing banter of her tone, “it’s very terrible! You care
for Georges, and Georges cares for you, and all the world is against you—mamma, and
Madame Eekhof, and everybody, eh? ’Tis sad, very sad, isn’t it? And I can quite understand
how little hope you have that it will ever be otherwise! How sad, how unfortunate
it is, to be sure!”
</p>
<p>“Oh, Marie! how can you talk like that when you know—when you know it pains me?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; I am cruel, eh?” Marie resumed, but her smile grew gentler. “Come, Lili, do
cease crying now, and give me a kiss; forgive me for what I said. Shall I have another
try, and see if I can induce mamma to change her mind?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, <i>do</i>, there’s a good soul! Mamma will consent if <i>you</i> ask her.”
</p>
<p>“Yes; no one refuses <i>me</i>, eh? With me all goes smoothly. ’Tis only against you that everybody’s hand is raised.
Poor, poor child!”
</p>
<p>Lili laughed between her tears as she looked at Marie.
</p>
<p>“Marie, how droll you are when you sermonize like that! It makes me laugh, really.”
</p>
<p>“All right, sissy, <i>you</i> laugh away; let us laugh as long as we may. Well, good-bye; put your hair straight
a little; I am going to mamma.”
</p>
<p>She nodded to Lili and left the room, envying her sister who could freely express
what she felt, and as she was going down the stairs she smiled a little sad smile
when she thought of Lili’s grief and despair about Georges. Her sister seemed to her
as a child crying for its toys; she could already see Lili’s little face, now so bitterly
sorrowful, beam with gladness, as it would do when she, Marie, should return to her
in half an hour.
</p>
<p>Happy Lili! that she might weep so freely—that she might exclaim with such exultation—“What
do we care for Madame Eekhof, if we like each other?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>They were bound for a farm-house, kept by a farmer with whom the Verstraetens were
well acquainted. The road taken lay along the Loosduinschen Weg, and the passengers
by the brake felt far from comfortable in the sweltering rays of the mid-day sun,
which poured its fierce rays mercilessly down upon their heads. Madame Verstraeten
and Mathilde sat on a back seat, with Nico between them; Marie, Lili and Frédérique,
Paul, Etienne and Georges were their <i>vis-à-vis</i>, the front bench being occupied by Tine and Lientje, and the little cousins Verstraeten;
Johan and little Cateau van der Stoor sat on the box. It would be a cosy little party,
entirely among themselves, without the presence of strangers, who would only have
interfered with their freedom. Marie was taking handfuls of cherries from a big basket
and distributing them all round, and Etienne, between his mouthfuls, was relating
how Marguerite van Laren had declared that a brake was a plebeian conveyance.
</p>
<p>“When the van Larens go to a picnic they always go in court carriages, I suppose,
with powdered footmen!” said Georges.
</p>
<p>“In <i lang="fr">toilettes à la Watteau</i>, and leading little lambs attached to pink ribbons,” added Lili, and they smiled
at each other.
</p>
<p>Every one laughed, and they felt in a very good humour, the girls in their simple
cotton frocks, the young men in their light summer suits and straw hats.
</p>
<p>“Cateau, will you have some cherries?” asked Marie, and a handful went across to Cateau.
“There you are, divide with Jan.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, I shall get my share,” cried Jan, in his loud voice. “Toos, shall I show you
a little trick?”
</p>
<p>“What sort of trick?” asked Toos.
</p>
<p>“Look, you see those two cherries, don’t you? Now then, put that one in your mouth;
that’s right.”
</p>
<p>“Well, and what then?” asked Toos, doing as she was asked.
</p>
<p>“Then I shall take the other, do you see? There!” continued the rascal, and opened
his mouth for the second cherry with a smacking kiss on Cateau’s lips.
</p>
<p>“I say, Jan!” said Madame Verstraeten indignantly.
</p>
<p>“That Cateau! what a stupid girl!” cried Freddie laughing.
</p>
<p>“I didn’t know what he was going to do,” declared Cateau; “that wretched boy!”
</p>
<p>“Come, Toos, nonsense, you knew all about it!” teased Paul.
</p>
<p>Cateau was in despair because Paul refused to believe her.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>And the brake rattled on along meadows full of fat grazing cattle, their hides of
black and white glossy as satin, while the willows along the edges of the ditches
waved their fans of silver-gray foliage from the summits of their gnarled stems.
</p>
<p>“I think a willow is such a melancholy tree, don’t you, Georges?” asked Lili.
</p>
<p>“Oh, Lili is getting poetic!” cried Etienne. “Come, Lili, an ode to the willow.”
</p>
<p>“It seems I can’t say a thing but you must all laugh at me,” answered Lili pouting.
“I must be very ridiculous?”
</p>
<p>And they continued to tease her, whilst the cherries rained thick and fast in everybody’s
lap, amid general laughter. The road grew hilly, whilst in the distance the duny heights
arose. Here and there was a villa, hidden amid the foliage, or a farm-house, with
fields of turnips and cauliflowers, and rows of climbing beans, or a little garden
full of sunflowers, geraniums, and tuberoses. A washerwoman busily wringing clothes
by the side of a ditch raised herself up and smiled, and two peasant children ran
behind the carriage to catch the cherries which Jan and Cateau threw to them.
</p>
<p>The road undulated between yellow fields of oats and flax, bespeckled with the blue
and red of corn-flowers and wild peas, until at length the farm-house was reached.
The farmer’s wife appeared at the gate with a kindly smile, and from all sides they
sprang from the brake, while Madame Verstraeten and Mathilde lifted down an array
of boxes, baskets, and hampers. The driver got down from the box and led his steaming
horses to the stable. Jan Verstraeten, little Cateau, and the young van Ryssels soon
took possession of the two swings. Jan had promised Madame van Ryssel that he would
be careful, and Cateau would look after Nico.
</p>
<p>“They are just like a married couple with their offspring!” laughed Marie, as she
followed them with her eyes.
</p>
<p>“I’ll drive them all away from the swing in a moment; I want to swing as well,” cried
Etienne noisily, intoxicated with the sun and the fresh air. “Lili, will you have
a swing with me presently?—at least, if de Woude does not mind,” he whispered, with
longing eyes.
</p>
<p>“De Woude has nothing to say about me. But I don’t care for swinging, it gives me
a headache, thanks.”
</p>
<p>“I am madly fond of it, Eetje,” cried Marie; “I shall be ready in a moment; but high,
very high, do you hear? Up to the clouds.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb181">[<a href="#pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Come, let us go and look for a nice little spot, a little further on the dunes,”
said Paul.
</p>
<p>“Oh, of course; Paul is thinking of his comfort again. But the dunes are very hot,
Paully,” said Freddie.
</p>
<p>“No; there are trees, oaks I think, the other side of the pavilion.”
</p>
<p>“Right away, then. It really is too hot to bustle about much. I am of Paul’s opinion;
I like a lazy picnic: lounging in the shade and watching the clouds overhead,” lisped
Lili.
</p>
<p>“Lili always manages to unite the languorous with the poetical,” laughed her sister.
“In Heaven’s name, de Woude, propose something. We are all chattering at once, and
you—you say nothing.”
</p>
<p>Georges laughed, and they went, picking their way through the overhanging foliage,
and pushing back the leafy branches, which again closed behind them with a rustling
sound. Lili started, frightened at a spider which hovered over her attached to its
silvery thread, and when de Woude brushed away the insect they became the objects
of general teasing: she, as the timid maiden; he, as a brave knight, slaying the dragons
that surrounded her.
</p>
<p>“But what have we done, that you are always down upon us?” cried Georges.
</p>
<p>“Oh, Georges, don’t you trouble yourself about it,” said Lili. “They think they are
very witty. Oh, Paul, how you let us clamber along in this heat. ’Tis quite a journey
to that pretty spot of yours. And those tiresome branches too. Ooh!”
</p>
<p>She glanced, pouting, at her finger, which had received a scratch from a thorn.
</p>
<p>“Let me walk in front of you,” whispered Georges, and he said it so softly and glided
so deftly in front of her that the others, amid their laughter at Lili’s mishap, did
not notice it. The two dropped behind a little, and Lili smilingly followed after
him, while Georges held back the branches until they could no longer touch her face.
</p>
<p>“Let them laugh! You don’t care, do you?” he asked, entirely absorbed in his happiness.
</p>
<p>“Not a bit,” she answered calmly, shaking her little fair head under the big hat,
while a mocking smile formed about her mouth. “We can laugh at them now. Who is that
shrieking?”
</p>
<p>“Etienne, of course,” said Georges.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span></p>
<p>Paul and Etienne had come upon a grassy spot beneath the chestnut trees, from which
a small panorama could be seen: some meadow-land, interspersed by the straight lines
of the ditches, sparkling under the bright sky, and here and there a cow. In the distance
a little windmill, and beyond it a border of poplars, stately and slender.
</p>
<p>Lili and Georges approached, and found the others in rapture.
</p>
<p>“It’s glorious here,” said Paul. “Cool moss to lie on, and a fine view.”
</p>
<p>They all agreed that it was a pleasant spot, and sat down on the ground, tired with
their reconnoitring. They removed their hats, which, together with the lace or red
parasols of the girls, soon covered the dark greensward with glowing colour, whilst
here and there a stray sunbeam, penetrating through the foliage, threw a myriad of
glittering, dancing dust-particles across the light cotton of their frocks, and the
yellow and brown shades of their hair.
</p>
<p>“It isn’t so very shady here, after all. At all events I am quite in the sun,” said
Lili, hiding herself in the rosy shade of her <i lang="fr">en-tout-cas</i>, and she cast an indignant glance on Paul, who had a very shady place, and was lying
full length on the ground, his head cosily hidden in a handkerchief.
</p>
<p>“Hush, Lili, don’t talk; go to sleep,” he whispered, with closed eyes.
</p>
<p>“You are very entertaining; <i>you</i> sleep on then. But I am scorching here.”
</p>
<p>“Shall we go and look for a better spot, Lili?” said Georges.
</p>
<p>“Yes, do; that’s a good idea,” thought Paul.
</p>
<p>“And just whistle when you have found one,” said Etienne.
</p>
<p>Georges promised he would. They rose, after which Lili, leaning on him, descended
the dune.
</p>
<p>“That Lili is always so fussy,” yawned Paul, in his handkerchief.
</p>
<p>But his laziness was too much for Etienne, who pulled him down the hillock by his
legs, to the great amusement of the girls.
</p>
<p>It was very warm, however, and they could not help it—they too began to feel lazy.
They would walk about after lunch. When peace had been restored between Paul and Etienne,
Frédérique laid her head on Eetje’s knees, whilst he tickled her ears with a straw;
Paul was half asleep, languid with heat and comfort, and Marie sat staring contemplatively,
with a suggestion of sadness about her mouth, at the meadows and the ditches and the
grazing cattle.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p>The path along which Georges and Lili descended was a very easy one. She floated down,
as it were, her hands clasping his shoulder, and he hurried at a quick pace. Quicker
and quicker he went; and she laughed lightly; it was as though she were endowed with
wings.
</p>
<p>“How stupid of them to stay there under that burning sun! Look, over yonder, under
those trees.”
</p>
<p>“Those chestnuts?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; shall we try?”
</p>
<p>“Yes.”
</p>
<p>They clambered up, he assisting her, and penetrated through on to the wooded hillocks.
It was delightfully cool and shady there, whilst just a few paces off the sun was
scorching.
</p>
<p>“Oh! isn’t it pretty here?” cried Lili. “And look, violets!”
</p>
<p>She sat down on the mossy sand, and picked the flowers. And he lay down at her feet,
too happy to say much, and played with the red tassels of her parasol.
</p>
<p>“Come, now, you must whistle, Georges, as a signal for the others to come,” she said
archly, knowing full well that he would not.
</p>
<p>“I can’t whistle, I never could,” he answered, and looked at her laughing.
</p>
<p>She laughed too, and threw her violets in his face. He gathered them up, and placed
them in his button-hole. Then he took her hand, and looked in her face.
</p>
<p>“Do you like me?” he asked, his eyes fixed on hers. She laid her little white hands
on his shoulders, and looking him straight in the face, slowly bent her head.
</p>
<p>“What?” he asked, full of tenderness. “Do you like me?” he repeated, and she bent
down, so that his lips touched the little locks on her forehead, and kissed them.
</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, and she let her head rest against his face. “Yes, I like you.”
</p>
<p>Thus they remained for a while, whilst he, in his uncomfortable posture, enjoyed the
weight of the little head on his face. But when she raised herself, and once more
smilingly looked at him, he approached closer to her side, and laid her arm round
his neck.
</p>
<p>“Do you know, Emilie——” he commenced.
</p>
<p>“What?” she asked.
</p>
<p>“Emilie has been speaking to my father; mightn’t she come and speak with your parents?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Yes,” she answered, with a beaming smile. “But I don’t know—I don’t think——”
</p>
<p>“Emilie knows how to talk.”
</p>
<p>“You are very fond of her, eh?”
</p>
<p>“Yes—and of you too.”
</p>
<p>She pressed his head closer in the soft bend of her arm and gave him a kiss on his
forehead—her first!
</p>
<p>And the odour of the moss and the violets became mingled together into a fragrant
sigh, whose sweetness made her feel faint, whilst her little hand closed caressingly,
and disarranged his light-brown hair. She listened, still with that same happy smile,
to his soft voice, as he was telling her of the conversation he had had with his sister,
before he knew whether Lili would ever care for him. For a time he had certainly felt
anxious; now, however, the whole world seemed to him one smiling landscape.
</p>
<p>“Emilie thought you would not have a poor husband. Won’t you have a poor husband?”
</p>
<p>“Are you poor?”
</p>
<p>“Well, I am not rich.”
</p>
<p>“All right, then I will have a poor husband. I can be <i>so</i> economical. Sometimes I make a month’s dress money last me for three months. And
don’t I always look neat?”
</p>
<p>“Charming.”
</p>
<p>“But I don’t believe you are very economical. I think you have a great many more wants
than I.”
</p>
<p>“I shall have no wants, when I have you. You will be all to me.”
</p>
<p>“Does Emilie care for me?”
</p>
<p>“Rather! she shall be our little mother. And you will accompany me everywhere? To
Cairo? To Constantinople? To the Cape?”
</p>
<p>“To Lapland if you like—everywhere.”
</p>
<p>“My own little woman.”
</p>
<p>He clasped her close to his bosom and kissed her. It was as though the world vanished
from them and left them alone in paradise. It seemed to them as though no other couple
had ever loved so fondly, as though there had never been any love but theirs.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“Mamma wants to know if you are coming to lunch?” cried Johan van Ryssel to the four,
lying sunning themselves yonder. “You lazy people! hallo! you are all asleep, I believe.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>And he clambered towards them and fought with Paul, whose big limbs, stretched at
their full length, irritated him. Frédérique and Etienne raised themselves up, and
admitted being hungry.
</p>
<p>“Through doing nothing, I suppose?” cried Jan, who came to call them too. “We have
been swinging and riding in the donkey-cart and climbing a haystack, and you—you can
do nothing but doze.”
</p>
<p>“Hush! more respect for age, please,” said Marie with dignity.
</p>
<p>They all descended the path along which they had come, again struggling with the overhanging
branches that barred their passage, when they heard a whistling behind them. On turning
round they caught sight of Georges and Lili, full of mysterious gaiety.
</p>
<p>“We have found a nice little spot, very cool!” said Georges ironically.
</p>
<p>“Oh, so cool!” repeated Lili.
</p>
<p>At that they became the butt of indignant glances, and so they wisely lagged behind
a little; still they took good care to be in time to join the others at the lunch-table.
</p>
<p>Madame Verstraeten and Mathilde had been very busy, notwithstanding the heat. On the
coarse white table-cloth there arose heaps of little rolls, together with dishes full
of cherries and strawberries, and a big basin of cream between two golden <i lang="nl">tulbands</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3509src" href="#xd31e3509">1</a> Sixteen chairs were ranged around the table, and the little van Ryssels, flushed
with the heat, tired after running, with sparkling eyes and moist hair, looked at
it all with longing. Nico was already seated at table rattling his fork against his
glass, and all now sat down, and Madame Verstraeten and Mathilde were soon busy handing
round the different things.
</p>
<p>“De Woude, take what you like,” said Madame Verstraeten, and soon the spot resounded
with noisy laughter, whilst the rolls and the tulbands disappeared as if by magic,
and the fowls were running about nervously round the table, keeping close to Nico,
who to Mathilde’s despair offered them immense slices of bread. Jan in the meantime
found a fresh cause to reproach the three young men with their laziness.
</p>
<p>Behind the farmhouse there was a broad stream, and a little boat lay moored alongside.
Jan and Cateau wanted to disport themselves in it, but Madame Verstraeten would not
permit them, <span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>unless some one older than they accompanied them. So after lunch they stormed up to
Paul and Etienne, who were to row them; Jan promised to be a good steersman.
</p>
<p>“Do you think Georges and Lili are safe together?” asked Paul, as he pushed off the
boat from the shore with his scull. “Come, Etienne, keep time.”
</p>
<p>“Where are they? Oh, look, there they go, behind that hedge!” cried Frédérique. “Marie,
fancy you as elder sister allowing such a thing.”
</p>
<p>Marie laughed kindly.
</p>
<p>“Oh, let them be happy,” she answered simply.
</p>
<p>Etienne made himself very busy, just to hide his want of skill as an oarsman, whilst
he made the strongest possible movements with his oar. Paul grew more desperate every
moment.
</p>
<p>“I say, Etienne, you don’t know anything about it; for heaven’s sake don’t splash
like that.”
</p>
<p>A shower of spray fell upon them.
</p>
<p>“You are soaking me,” said Frédérique indignantly.
</p>
<p>“Go along, do you think I can’t row?”
</p>
<p>Cateau and Jan laughed at Etienne, and he carried on in such a ridiculous way, that
Toosje at last summed up courage to ask Paul to let her have a row; for she looked
upon Mr. van Raat as the captain. Etienne, in spite of his boisterous remonstrances,
which nearly caused the boat to capsize, was removed from his seat, and Cateau set
herself down triumphantly beside Paul, full of eagerness to keep time with him in
the lifting and dropping of her oar, which she clasped, without fear of blisters,
closely in her hands. And she enjoyed it when their sculls, as if moved by one power,
feathered in light and measured stroke over the greenish water.
</p>
<p>“Splendid, Cateau; you understand it!” said Marie. “Jan, just steer across to those
lilies.”
</p>
<p>Jan steered, and the little boat glided slowly to a pool coated with duckweed, upon
which the white cups of the water-lilies floated amid a wealth of flat, glossy green
leaves. Marie bent forward, grasped a lily by its tough slimy stalk, and tugged and
tugged until she pulled the flower out of the duckweed.
</p>
<p>“Over there, look, there are a lot,” cried Jan, pointing to the other side.
</p>
<p>And they glided on between overhanging willows, their silver-leafed branches bending
over the water, and a long line of meadow-land, <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>and Marie mechanically pulled the muddy flowers out of the water. She no longer heard
the laughter of the others; how little Cateau and Etienne were having a lively dispute
as to in what fashion an oar was to be handled. She continued, without fear of soiling
herself with the mud, wrenching out the flowers, whose stalks she cast at her feet,
like so many slippery eels; she wrenched and wrenched so hard that the stalks nearly
bruised her hands. Thus too one could wrench a thought from one’s mind, though the
heart bled from it.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The young van Ryssels, whom Mathilde did not trust in the boat while Etienne was in
it, again consoled themselves with their swing. Tina pushed Nico, who was sitting
very dignified, to and fro, whilst Johan, with Lientje sitting between his legs, disported
himself on the second swing. But now approached Marie and Etienne, and when Nico was
tired of his dignified attitude they both clambered on to the plank.
</p>
<p>“High, Eetje, very high!” cried Marie.
</p>
<p>Etienne, with his feet firmly placed against the plank, soon sent the swing forward.
</p>
<p>“Ah! I see you are a better hand at swinging than at rowing,” cried Marie.
</p>
<p>She too pushed the swing forward, and it swung higher and higher, whilst her dress
fluttered in the wind, her hat blew off, and a few hairs dangled about her face. She
took a deep breath, as high up in the air she hung over Etienne almost horizontally,
and swayed up and down. She felt a sensation as if an unfathomable abyss yawned beneath
her, and as if she rose higher and higher into the blue sky, borne upward on the wings
of a great bird. Her eyes sparkled, her cheeks glowed, and she fain would have let
go the ropes, and in a desperate flight plunged herself into space.
</p>
<p>Then she caught sight of the four children below, who were staring in open-mouthed
and envious wonder at the “big folk” who were allowed to swing so high, and she wanted
to call them, but her tongue refused to utter a sound. Etienne was as if intoxicated,
and higher, still higher, swung the plank.
</p>
<p>“Etienne—enough—enough, Etienne!” murmured Marie, and she closed her eyes.
</p>
<p>And she felt quite dazed when the great bird slowly slackened <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>the speed of its flight, and at last ceased altogether. She tottered when she was
on <i lang="la">terra firma</i> once more.
</p>
<p>Etienne picked up her hat.
</p>
<p>“A glorious swing, wasn’t it, eh?” he cried, out of breath.
</p>
<p>Marie nodded smilingly, and with a gasp and a sigh brushed the dishevelled hair from
her face. And when Etienne took to his legs and ran, shouting to his little cousins
that they could not catch him, and when the young van Ryssels ran after him, Nico
last of all, waddling along on his fat little legs—then Marie, on the grass by the
side of the swing, burst into tears. She thought of Lili and Georges, how happy those
two had been, whilst she, Marie, had sat gazing at the meadows and the cows until
stars shimmered before her eyes; and how happy they, Georges and Lili, had been, while
she had been wrenching the lilies out of the water—hard, very hard, with all her might.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Eline, Eline!” was shouted from the garden. Eline sprang out of bed in a fright,
on finding it was half-past seven. At the Horze the breakfast hour was eight, and
so she hurried with her toilette. Half dressed she walked to the open window, and
looked out. There were Théodore’s two eldest girls, Marianne and Henriette, sixteen
and fourteen years old.
</p>
<p>“Good morning!” Eline said cheerily.
</p>
<p>“What, are you up already? Well, that’s quick, I am sure! Are you coming down soon?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; I shall be ready in a moment.”
</p>
<p>“Morning, Eline!” she heard a new voice shouting. Eline looked out and caught sight
of Gustave, a good-looking little fellow of ten, with a pair of saucy blue eyes, a
regular street arab, with ever-dirty hands, and comical as a young clown.
</p>
<p>“Morning, Gus,” she cried.
</p>
<p>“I say, Eline, you know what you promised me?”
</p>
<p>“No.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>“You will marry me, and not Uncle Otto, eh? You have promised me, you know.”
</p>
<p>“Yes; all right, Gus. But I must make haste and dress, or I shall never be ready!”
cried Eline, again busy with her hair in front of the glass.
</p>
<p>She could hear the bustle in the garden increase every moment, and it made her nervous.
Her fine eyes were still rather small, her fringy curls did not fall as she wanted
them. Again from out of the garden, full of sunlight and shadow, a cheery hum of voices
ascended, among which she could distinguish Théodore’s big voice, as well as the lusty
shouts of the little van Ryssels.
</p>
<p>“Eline, Eline!” again came from many, many voices.
</p>
<p>“Yes, yes; I am coming!” Eline shouted back almost impatiently, and she buckled her
belt and rushed out of her room, through the long corridor, sombre in its brown oak
panelling, down the broad stairs, and out of the hall.
</p>
<p>In the garden Cathérine Howard was walking with Otto, her brother. She was not pretty,
but she had a pleasant cheerful face, and she was almost as lively in her movements
as Etienne.
</p>
<p>“Oh, Otto, I can well understand it,” she said affectionately, as she hung on his
arm. “I think she is a dot of a girl. From Freddie’s and Mathilde’s letters I expected
to see something of a coquette, because I really didn’t much remember, it’s so long
since I saw her, and then it was only for a moment or two at a time, when she was
living with that old aunt—a widow, a Madame Vere, I believe, was it not?”
</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Otto.
</p>
<p>“But now, on closer acquaintance, I think she is a darling. There is something so
winning and frank about her way of speaking, something very simple and unaffected,
and yet <i lang="fr">distingué</i>. And she is a little doll, really very pretty.”
</p>
<p>“Do you think so?” said Otto.
</p>
<p>“I should think so. You may well be proud of her; it isn’t every one who can get such
a wifie as that. Ah, there goes the bell! they are always early birds here.”
</p>
<p>They walked towards the open room, which looked on to the garden, and entered. Old
Madame van Erlevoort was already seated at the long breakfast-table, and gave a smiling
nod to her son and daughter. Eline stood talking to Théodore, who reminded her neither
of Otto nor of Etienne, as he stood there sturdy and <span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>broad-shouldered before her, with his well-set powerful frame, and his short full
beard; but in his loud cheery heavy voice there sounded the native, healthy good-nature
of the Erlevoorts.
</p>
<p>His wife, the young Madame van Erlevoort, or Truus as he called her, was still occupied,
with the assistance of Mathilde and Frédérique, in making a few more preparations
for the meal. Miss Frantzen set the little van Ryssels on their chairs, and fastened
their napkins about their throats. Etienne came in from the garden with Cor, Théodore’s
eighteen-year-old son, who was a midshipman, and was now staying at the Horze on furlough.
They were followed by the girls and the boys, Willy and Gustave, full of jokes and
fun at the expense of their English uncle Howard, whom they did not understand, and
whom they were to teach Dutch.
</p>
<p>“Good morning, Nily!” said Otto, approaching Eline.
</p>
<p>“Good morning, Otto!” answered Eline, and she offered him her hand, and they whispered
something together. She felt herself very happy in the new charm which a busy family
life had opened up to her. To her, who as a child had had no one but her sister for
a playmate, and whose early girlhood was half dreamed away in the depressing surroundings
of her aged aunt’s home, it was a newly-revealed happiness to be in the midst of such
a joyous stir, and she began to view life from another standpoint than she had done
while she was yet under the glamour of soirées and balls at the Hague. Every one was
cheerful and pleasant, even Frédérique; the children she allowed to clamber on to
her shoulder at their sweet will, freely letting them caress and fondle her with their
greasy little fingers, without the least fear for her dress or her head-gear. She
was in love with Tina, the dainty little miss, whom Eline’s charm of manner irresistibly
attracted, as it had once attracted Cateau van der Stoor, and at table Eline’s seat
was always between Otto and Tina. Old Madame van Erlevoort sat between her two youngest
grandchildren, Edmée and Kitty Howard, the only child of her English son-in-law, and
when she glanced along the table beaming with youthful gaiety, it seemed to her as
though there could be no one in the wide world happier than she, with her gray hair
and her youthful heart.
</p>
<p>After breakfast Théodore proposed a trip to the so-called “big tree,” for he declared
that of the many big trees of Gelderland the one at the Horze was the biggest. Howard,
Etienne, and Cor were to accompany him; Eline and Otto with the children joined <span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>them; even Edmée and Kitty, under the care of the three girls, stormed the covered
cart that was ready to convey them.
</p>
<p>In the breakfast-room an Atlantic gale seemed to have raged. The table was a chaos
of plates and glasses, the floor was bestrewn with serviettes, in the midst of which
lay Tina’s hat, a spade of Nico’s, and a ball of Edmée’s.
</p>
<p>“Isn’t it rather too noisy for you, mamma?” asked Truus, taking the hand of Madame
van Erlevoort—who was still seated at the disordered breakfast-table—in hers. “Really
the children make such a fearful din, that it seems quite a relief when they are gone.”
</p>
<p>“Come,” said the old lady, “you ought to be ashamed to talk like that.”
</p>
<p>“My four youngsters often nearly drive me to despair too,” remarked Mathilde; “but
with the exception of Cor, who is gradually growing a little more staid, yours seem
to take the palm for noisy young scapegraces.”
</p>
<p>“Don’t you trouble yourself about me, Truus,” said the old lady. “All through the
winter I long for the summer to come, when I can go to the Horze, and it does me good
to be with you all. And I think it very nice of you that you have asked Eline.”
</p>
<p>“Next year, when they are married, I have already asked them to come to London during
the season,” remarked Cathérine. “I like her very much.”
</p>
<p>Young Madame van Erlevoort looked rather thoughtful as she folded up a serviette.
</p>
<p>“And you, Truus,” asked her mother-in-law, who observed it, “you like her too, don’t
you?”
</p>
<p>“What shall I say, mamma? I know so little of her. I think it very nice of her that
she adapts herself so entirely to our ways and habits, so that I have no occasion
to stand upon ceremony, as with a stranger; I haven’t the time for that. So I do think
it nice of her. But you are aware I don’t at once go into raptures about people.”
</p>
<p>“That sounds too diplomatic to please me, child. As for me, I either like a person
or I don’t.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, you must not think I mean more than I say. I have only known Eline a week; she
has made a favourable impression upon me, I think her very charming, but I don’t yet
quite know whether I actually feel for her or not.”
</p>
<p>It was on Mathilde’s lips to say that she, who had known Eline <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>for years, was not quite certain of that either, but she said nothing.
</p>
<p>“And then again—but you must not be vexed, mamma, will you, now that we are on the
subject?”
</p>
<p>“No, no, child.”
</p>
<p>“You see, I can’t help thinking there’s something in Eline as if she will never feel
herself at home among our family. She adapts herself to us, as I said, but I am not
so sure that it comes quite from her heart. I don’t cause you pain with what I say,
do I? There is nothing I should like better than to find that I was mistaken in Eline,
and when I know a little more of her—eh, mamma?”
</p>
<p>She hesitated to say it right out; she did not care for Eline. She was a sturdy sensible
woman and a good mother, ruling over her little kingdom with loving care and prudence,
who, whilst ever friendly and cheerful, was also determined and firm, and made her
will pass as law. In the firmness of her character she generally came forward straight
with her meaning, but this time she knew that, as Otto’s intended wife, mamma already
looked upon Eline as one of the family; she had noticed that Eline could with a single
loving word or a single caress touch the old lady, and she did not like to pain mamma
in her son’s intended. But in their rural atmosphere—<i>that</i> she could not deny—Eline introduced a discord, as of something artificial, something
unreal, and this irritated Truus. She could not know that Eline was perhaps more herself
at the Horze than she had ever been elsewhere, that indeed she felt happy there in
the simple family life, that she felt as though a new, a purer, and a fresher life
had fallen to her share; she could not penetrate Eline’s inner thoughts, she could
but see on the surface; she saw not the sweet calm of those nerves, so long overstrung
in a life of excessive culture and luxury; she saw only the native worldliness glimmering
through a veil of affected simplicity, and this irritated her, as the big blue silk
sash on Eline’s print dress irritated her.
</p>
<p>Cathérine Howard was all indignation. How was it possible that Truus could say such
a thing? it was certainly not very becoming to an intended sister. And she galloped
along about Eline with almost childish ecstasy, in such affectionate words, that the
old lady, disconcerted at her daughter-in-law’s ideas, soon again beamed with pleasure.
</p>
<p>“No; really, Truus, I can’t make you out. I on the contrary <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>admire Eline, because, stranger as she is among our family, she so quickly made herself
at home. I can assure you that when I came to London with Howard—I did not know his
family at all, that’s true—but I must say I felt a little bit like a fish out of water
among them, cordial though they all were. But Eline—dear me! why ’tis as if I have
always known her; she is so easy, so accommodating, you have no trouble with her whatever.
No; I really can’t understand that you can even imagine that she will not feel herself
at home amongst us; I can’t say it’s very nice of you, I am sure.”
</p>
<p>Truus laughed at Cathérine’s indignation, and excused herself as well as she could,
and as the servant was coming in to clear the table, the old lady with Mathilde and
Cathérine went up-stairs, and sat down in the roomy, well-shaded balcony, while Truus
remained invisible for the rest of the morning, absorbed in her domestic duties.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The cart was already long out of sight. Théodore, Howard, Etienne, and Cor walked
in front, and Otto and Eline followed, under the shadow of her big lace parasol.
</p>
<p>The conversation of the four men was a mixture of English and Dutch; Howard declared
he could understand the latter, and was even able to speak a word or two, while Théodore
was continually coming to grief with his English in his explanations about tenants
and lands. Some labourers in their Sunday clothes passed by with a respectful salute.
</p>
<p>The road lay bathed in sunshine between the glowing gold of rye and oats, and not
a breath of wind stirred the stalks. Beyond, white and red, gleamed the blossoming
buckwheat. In the distance arose a farm-house from between a group of trees, with
a line of smoke rising like a faint gray plume against the blue of the sky.
</p>
<p>“I suppose you feel yourself here like a king in your own country?” said Howard.
</p>
<p>“Oh no!” answered Théodore. “I feel myself more peasant than king. But look round
a moment; there, right across the garden, there’s our palace.”
</p>
<p>They turned round and stood still, so that Otto and Eline soon overtook them. Through
a break in the dense foliage the Horze could be seen in the distance, white as milk,
with its little shutters and slender white turrets, the big vine-clad balconies relieving
the white monotony with leafy intervals. The lake lay as a round <span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>mirror in the midst of the fresh greensward, bespeckled with a white fluttering flight
of pigeons.
</p>
<p>“What a very pretty view!” said Eline, enraptured. “But see, who is that waving to
us?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, I suppose it’s grandma and the aunts,” cried Cor.
</p>
<p>They noticed in the shadow of a balcony a number of dark outlined figures, who appeared
to be waving handkerchiefs, and they all returned the signal, whilst Etienne shouted
“Hurrah.”
</p>
<p>“Come, let us make haste now,” said Théodore, “or we shall never get as far as the
big tree.”
</p>
<p>Eline spoke English fairly well, and with her Howard got on the best. He engaged her
in a lively conversation, whilst Eline on Otto’s arm, in the shade of her parasol,
which he held, laughingly replied to him. And Eline herself wondered how it was that
without the least effort she made an agreeable impression upon every man with whom
she came in contact, whilst the sympathies of those of her own sex she could only
succeed in enlisting by dint of exercising all the arts of her loving affection.
</p>
<p>Through her conversation, full of cheerful banter, the thought flashed like lightning—Madame
van Erlevoort cared for her only on account of Otto; Cathérine liked her out of light-heartedness,
but their sympathy was not firmly rooted in affection; with old Madame van Raat, with
little Cateau, with Tina, it was otherwise. And with a smile she leant heavier on
Otto; what cared she for all of them? his love well repaid her for what she missed
in others, his love was her wealth, and for the sympathy of others she cared nothing.
</p>
<p>To the big tree it was a good half-hour’s walk. The road bent through the golden corn-fields,
along hedges pink with blossom, by the side of hilly pine-copses, fragrant with pungent
odours, whose dark, sombre foliage afforded a grateful shade from the brilliant sun-rays.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, at a bend of the road, the little village of Horze was revealed as a surprise
to the eyes of the party; a few cottages, a baker’s shop, a minister’s house, an inn,
some stables, all scattered around a little church; and Eline glanced round wonderingly—she
did not see the village, she said.
</p>
<p>“But here it is—there—that <i>is</i> the village,” said Otto.
</p>
<p>“What! That house and a half?” asked Eline, her eyes big with surprise.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span></p>
<p>They all laughed, and Etienne asked her if she had expected to find a sort of Nice
or Biarritz.
</p>
<p>“At least something like Scheveningen, with a Kurhaus—eh, Elly? I say, Elly, do you
know the difference yet between rye and oats?”
</p>
<p>“Not quite. Buckwheat I know when I see it—flax I know, very light yellow—and potato-fields
I know. But rye and oats and barley, no; of them I know nothing whatever. Don’t worry
me about them, Etienne! But, Théodore, is this indeed Horze? Are you really lord and
master of these—one, two, three, four barns?”
</p>
<p>And she roared with laughter under the broad brim of her big straw hat; and they all
laughed at Eline’s innocent surprise, although Théodore felt a little hurt.
</p>
<p>Eline, however, quickly regretted her jest, which she felt was not quite in harmony,
and she declared that it was full of picturesque spots, a little house like that with
a cluster of trees, very pretty, really.
</p>
<p>“And the big tree, where is the big tree?” asked Eline.
</p>
<p>They passed through the village, between the pecking fowls, which scampered away frightened,
while the blacksmith and a couple of farmers, to each of whom Théodore addressed a
few words, heartily greeted their landlord, remaining for a while staring after his
guests. They crossed over a meadow, and Théodore shouted to a boy to hold a cow close
by them, as Eline was afraid of the huge, fat beast, with its big, staring eyes and
chewing mouth.
</p>
<p>“Etienne, Cor—do leave off, Cor!” she cried, on Otto’s arm, to Etienne and Cor, who,
to frighten the cow, set up a melancholy boo! boo!
</p>
<p>“You see, Eline, that’s because you laughed at Horze,” cried Théodore in his big bass,
but she looked at him laughingly and so softly between her half-closed lashes, that
he was quite disarmed, and asked Etienne and Cor to stop their silly noise. At the
end of the meadow stood the big tree, an oak with a colossal stem, tall and powerful
as a giant. Frédérique, Marianne, Henriette, and the children had already ensconced
themselves between its spreading roots. Howard and Eline were urged on all sides to
give vent to their admiration for the tree. Eline mustered forth a few words, such
as colossal, immense; but Théodore noticed from the mocking little smile that played
on her features, that the oak had made no impression whatever upon her, and he held
up his <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>finger to her threateningly, until she burst out in a peal of laughter, which was
renewed when Howard, in a very serious tone, declared—
</p>
<p>“A big tree, indeed! I never saw such a big one! Quite interesting!”
</p>
<p>“Wait, I shall give it to you!” cried Théodore, and he ran after Eline, who fled shrieking
with laughter until she fell down panting for breath on the grass, and holding out
her hands, cried—
</p>
<p>“Théodore, leave off, do you hear? I shall call Otto!”
</p>
<p>“I’ll show you! you naughty girl! Call Otto if you like. I’ll show you!” and he grasped
her wrists and shook her in fun, whilst she acted as if he hurt her terribly. Then
he assisted her to rise, and she promised, still laughing, not again to show so little
appreciation of the beauties of nature.
</p>
<p>The children with their English uncle were standing hand in hand, and trying to measure
the tree.
</p>
<p>“Absurd of Théodore to run after Eline like that,” muttered Frédérique, and Etienne
overheard her.
</p>
<p>“I say, you are getting tiresome,” he cried. “Why, you can’t bear a joke any longer.”
</p>
<p>By the side of the little church there was a hilly pine wood. There Eline sat down
on the moss, and rested her head on her hand. Otto sat beside her. They could just
hear the faint tinkling of a distant bell. It was church time. Some country people
in glossy broadcloth and shining silk aprons were walking, prayer-book in hand, along
the road, and Eline with her eyes followed them, themselves scarcely visible behind
the close-standing stems. The scattered church-goers were few in number; a few—late-comers—followed
hurriedly, and all was quiet under the peaceful influence of a rustic Sunday rest.
In the distance was heard the bleating of a goat.
</p>
<p>It is true Eline had imagined the Horze more grandiose and luxurious, and the very
simple life that was led at the country house made her smile at times when she called
to mind Ouida’s English castles, full of dukes and princes, such as those in which
she had her abode during her watch at Aunt Vere’s sick-bed. It was certainly very
different, that splendour of an ideal aristocracy, and this simplicity of a well-to-do
but necessarily frugal aristocracy, and yet she would not have exchanged her present
circumstances for anything, and she talked smilingly to Otto about Ouida and <span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>the English castles, and declared she gave the preference to the Horze, as she preferred
him, her poor country squire, to the wealthy Scotch duke, after the type of an Erceldoune
or a Strathmore, such as she used to dream about formerly.
</p>
<p>Yes; Eline felt her happiness growing greater and greater in that peaceful solitude
beneath the dark pine leaves, whilst Otto’s voice, deep and full, sounded in her ears.
He told her how he could not yet understand that she was his for ever, and that ere
long they should be as one; and he told her that she had but one fault—that she misjudged
herself. He, yes, he knew her as she really was; he told her that there were latent
treasures hidden within her, and that it would be his privilege to try and bring them
to light. In the fullness of her happiness she became frank and outspoken, even to
herself, as she never had been; she looked at him almost pityingly, and answered that
he would yet discover in her much that was bad, when he knew her better. No, indeed,
he did not thoroughly know her, although he thought so. There was so much going on
in one’s heart that one could not always disclose; at least, so it was in her case,
and she must confess that her thoughts were not always of the best, neither was she
always so even-tempered as she appeared to be whenever he saw her. She could be peevish,
and nervous, and melancholy without real cause; but certainly for his sake she would
endeavour to transform herself into something like the image he had formed of her
for himself; but what an idealist he was! She felt herself pure and good in that confession;
she knew now that she could freely reveal to him thoughts which she would not always
have confessed to herself; neither was she any more in fear of losing him through
some careless word; she saw how he loved her, and how she must be dearest to him in
the moments when she spoke to him about herself in that simple way, and often it seemed
to her as though he was her conscience, to which she could say all that a girl might
say. And the more she depreciated herself in those moments of sincerity, the more
he adored her, the more he thought he could read her very soul beneath that glamour
of beauty and grace.
</p>
<p>They heard the hymns of the peasantry proceeding from the church, like a deep, broad
stream of simple piety, and in their present mood that unskilled flood of song seemed
full of a poetry that mingled with the poetry of the dark tints of the foliage, with
the fragrance of the pine wood, with the love that was in their <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>hearts. And Eline felt her heart swell, and she raised herself up a little, and resting
her curly little head on his bosom, she could not keep herself from twining her arms
around his neck, and when she felt herself thus leaning against him with her bosom
on his heart a sudden sob shook her.
</p>
<p>“Eline, dearest, what—what is the matter?” he softly asked.
</p>
<p>“Nothing,” she answered, nearly dying in the exquisite ecstasy of her love and her
great happiness; “nothing; let me be—I am so—so happy!”
</p>
<p>And she lay weeping in his arms.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>At the Horze the hours of rising and bedtime were early, and the days fled by. The
life there, with the exception of a few rainy days, was almost exclusively an open-air
life. Their cheeks and their little hands were sunburnt, and they began to look like
little negroes, the young van Ryssels, the two boys, Willy and Gustave, and Edmée
and Kitty Howard. Among the pigeons which fluttered from their house over the lake
<i>they</i> fluttered round, sometimes anxiously followed by Miss Frantzen, Truus’ governess,
and Cathérine’s English nurse; especially by Miss Frantzen, who was in constant fear
at the thought of Nico and the water. They inspected the aviary and the stables, and
were on the best of terms with the gardener and his men, with the coachman and the
stable-boy. They fed the birds and the fowls and ducks, and rode round, firmly held
by the good-natured stableman, on Théodore’s unsaddled riding-horse, or went swimming,
or visited the gymnasium, where they watched the feats of Théodore, who was very powerfully
made, and of Howard, who was more lithe and supple, whilst Otto declared he had lost
the art, and Etienne swung wildly from ring to ring and jumped over the vaulting-horse.
But it was at Cor that the little van Ryssels stared in open-mouthed wonder, as they
saw him, with a rather conceited expression, very calmly and deliberately go through
the most difficult evolutions, in all the youthful strength of his long, slender limbs.
After coffee the boys played cricket with Howard, or in the shade of the lofty trees
in the park joined in lawn-tennis with the girls, or lay lazily under a tree with
a book doing nothing at all, their hands folded behind their heads. After dinner they
walked or floated about a little in the little boat on the lake, and the evening came,
and it was ten o’clock ere they thought of it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p>And her happiness, and the luxury of that sunny country life, made Eline feel so entirely
herself, that she wondered whether she really were the same girl of some months before.
She felt quite another being; it seemed to her as if her soul had escaped from its
glossy draperies, and now was before her in all its simplicity, in the nude whiteness
of a statue. She no longer veiled herself in her affectation, she no longer played
a part; she was her own self, her Otto’s darling, and this sincerity lent such a new
charm to her movements, to the slightest word she uttered, that Truus, to the triumph
of Cathérine, admitted she had been mistaken in her; that Frédérique would sometimes
sit talking to her for hours, with sisterly frankness; that Madame van Erlevoort called
her an angel. When she was alone and for a while revelled in her fresh train of thoughts
and emotions, the tears started to her eyes, in gratitude for all the good bestowed
on her, and she only wished that time would not fly by, that the present moment might
remain for ever. Beyond that she desired nothing, and around her there hovered an
infinite rest, an ethereal calm, an ecstasy of bliss.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>They retired early at the Horze; at half-past ten every one was at rest. Eline had
been chatting for an hour in Frédérique’s room, and she felt happy at Frédérique’s
ever-growing sympathy. She had been sitting on the edge of the bed, whilst Freddie
was already inside it, and they had talked to each other about all kinds of matters.
At times they laughed much, but subdued their laughter, for it was very quiet in the
house. At length Eline softly slipped out on the tips of her toes, and once more found
herself alone in her own little room. She lit her candle and slowly proceeded to undress,
with an unconscious and happy smile about her lips. For a moment she remained seated,
and mused, with her thick hair hanging down, and her bare arms and throat, and the
same smile still on her lips. She wished for nothing, nothing more, she had all that
her heart desired.
</p>
<p>And she opened her window and looked out. The rain had ceased, and an odour of damp
foliage was wafted towards her. The sky was clear, except for a few filmy cloudlets,
and the brilliant crescent of the moon seemed as though placed in relief against the
deep blue heavens; the fields lay silently spread out before her; a single little
windmill lifted its black wings motionless in the pale moonlight; the ditches gleamed
like streaks of silver, and a fragrant <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>freshness arose from the slumbering landscape, like a soft faint sigh. Eline leaned
against the window, and folded her arms across her bare throat. To her it seemed as
though that fragrant freshness, that faint sigh, refreshed and sweetened all her thoughts
as with an odour of field flowers, that chased away the unhealthy, enervating miasma
of her former emotions, like an overpowering perfume of musk and opoponax. She felt
herself so young, as she had never felt before, and oh! of that she was certain—never
had she loved as she loved now—never, never! Her Otto! When she thought of him, she
did not feel it necessary to call to her mind some idealized image; she thought of
him as he actually was, so manly and frank in his genial simplicity, and with one
single thought that ruled his whole being, the thought of her. His love was so rich,
so full, his love filled him completely. And hers grew every day, she thought—no,
it could grow no more! No further wish was hers, no more brooding over the future.
In due course it would unfurl itself before her, a perspective glowing with brightness
and gold! Nothing more remained than the stillness of that lake into which her soul
had glided, nothing besides the rest and the love of that blue ecstasy, full of bliss!
Only that, nothing else, nothing more! What indeed could human soul yet wish for?
</p>
<p>Only one little darkening streak amid all that blue. Only the fear—the fear that it
would ever be different. It was so long since she had prayed, she did not even know
how to pray; but now, now she would gladly have done so, have prayed that it would
ever be thus, that it might never change, always that soft happiness, always that
restfulness and peace, that blue ether.
</p>
<p>“Never, never again as once! God—ever thus, ever as now! Were it to change, I should
die,” she whispered inaudibly, and as she folded her hands a tear trembled on her
lashes. But it was a tear of joy, for in her happiness that vague fear was dissolved
like a drop in the ocean.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the Hague, August passed by glowing hot, but the nights were cool on the terrace
at Scheveningen, or in the tent of the Bosch. It was Sunday evening, and Betsy stayed
at home; old Madame van Raat had not been to see her for so long, that she asked her
mother-in-law to come around; Sunday was not much of a day at Scheveningen. They were
to drink tea in the conservatory, the glass doors of which were already open. Henk
walked with Madame van Raat through the garden, and the old lady admired his splendid
roses. Betsy and Vincent sat alone.
</p>
<p>“I have had a letter from Eline: she is coming back with the Erlevoorts on Wednesday.
The Howards will remain a little longer at the Horze,” she said.
</p>
<p>“Indeed?” answered Vincent. “And when Eline returns I must go, I suppose?” he asked
bluntly.
</p>
<p>Betsy felt alarmed, but she smiled very pleasantly.
</p>
<p>“The idea! Not at all. You know, our house is always open to you, until you have found
something for yourself. Don’t you hear anything from—what is the name of that friend
in New York?”
</p>
<p>“Lawrence St. Clare. No; I have not heard anything from him for some time. You see
one forgets one’s friends when they are so far away. I can’t blame him.”
</p>
<p>He leaned back in his cane chair with an air of something like resignation. In the
meantime he felt himself very well at ease, and agreeably soothed by the luxury which
surrounded him. The garden was well kept, rich in flowers and statuary. And in those
surroundings, in the presence of Betsy, very elegant in her light summer dress, by
the soft glitter of the silver and the Japanese porcelain, he felt himself safe against
the many unpleasantnesses of life. It was rest, monotonous if you like, but soothing
and refreshing. Betsy he knew how to master, but it was unnecessary to make his power
felt; besides, he was too lazy for it. Was not his present life an easy one? what
should he trouble himself about?
</p>
<p>“What would you say if I were to seek a wife?” he suddenly asked, inwardly thinking
of the pleasures a wealthy marriage might provide him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span></p>
<p>“A wife! oh, a splendid idea! Shall I try and find one for you? What sort of one do
you wish?”
</p>
<p>“Handsome she need not be, only elegant. Not too unsophisticated or idealistic. Money
of course.”
</p>
<p>“Of course. A foolish love-affair I certainly don’t look for in you. What do you think
of the Eekhofs?”
</p>
<p>“Are you mad? two giggling ninnies—and no money, is there?”
</p>
<p>“Some say there is, others declare that they live too extravagantly; any way you might
try and find out. But were you in earnest, Vincent, or was it only by way of saying
something?”
</p>
<p>“Not at all. I think I should do well if I married. Don’t you think I’m right?”
</p>
<p>Betsy looked at him searchingly, and her glance was full of secret contempt. With
his lack-lustre eyes, his languid movements, his indolent voice, he did not much impress
her as an ideal husband for a young girl.
</p>
<p>“Not quite. I think you are a terrible egotist; neither do I believe that a wife would
find much support in you. You are weak—I mean morally, of course.”
</p>
<p>She soon regretted her words and felt irritated at her own imprudence. She nearly
shuddered when he looked at her with that mysterious smile, with those soft, dull,
snake-like eyes.
</p>
<p>“And a wife has always need of support, eh?” he said in measured tones. “You too,
don’t you—you find your support in Henk? you depend entirely upon him, and he is strong
enough—I mean physically, of course?”
</p>
<p>Every word he uttered he emphasized as with a spiteful meaning, and every word pierced
sharp as a needle into her domineering nature; but she dared not answer him, she shrank
back in fear and only smiled, as if he had merely made a jest. He too laughed, a kindly
gentle laugh like hers, but full of veiled revengefulness.
</p>
<p>They were both silent for a while, conscious of the struggle under that outward show
of good-nature, until Betsy began gently to murmur some complaints about old Madame
van Raat, who always misunderstood her, and with whom she could never agree; and whilst
he sat indifferently listening to her, she felt how she abhorred him, how glad she
would have been, after having him in the house for a month, to give him his <i>congé</i>; but she knew that she could never do it without risking a terrible scene; he would
continue hanging about till the end of time, and she could not think of any means
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>get him away. It was all Henk’s fault; if he’d only given him that wretched little
sum the idea would never have entered her mind to ask him into the house. She detested
Vincent, and she detested herself for her fear of him. She was rich and happy; what
harm could he do her? But the more she argued, the more the fear clung to her, like
an enervating idiosyncrasy, of which she could not free herself.
</p>
<p>Madame van Raat and Henk were slowly returning from the garden, and they sat down
in the conservatory at one of the open glass doors. But after a few words about the
roses, the old lady grew quiet and pensive. Amid the luxury of her son’s house a certain
chill, a vacuum, seemed to seize her and make her melancholy, even more melancholy
than she was in her own lonely house. She had never had that feeling before when she
was with Henk; but now it seemed as if her love for her son did not yield sufficient
warmth to dispel that chill vacuum. And suddenly the truth struck her. She missed
Eline—Eline who, wherever she went, beamed forth the light of her fascination; she
missed her dear child, so different from Betsy, so loving and sympathetic. And she
could not help saying in her sad voice—
</p>
<p>“Your house seems deserted without Elly. What will it be when she is married and gone
away for good? Dear Elly!”
</p>
<p>She did not hear what Betsy and Vincent answered; she did not hear what Henk said;
she let her gray head fall upon her bosom and sat staring in front of her, the bony
hands folded in her lap. Life seemed hollow to her, a gray existence full of grief,
full of partings and tears, in which men hovered round, sombre and sad, like so many
tragic phantoms. And she shuddered when Betsy asked her whether she was cold.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Betsy, though she had never confessed it, had, just like her mother-in-law, in spite
of Vincent, who “was so sociable,” also found it lonely and miserable in the house.
There was so little change in the summer; it was eternally the tent and eternally
Scheveningen; she was really getting sick of it. And now that Eline was back, beaming
in her fresh happiness, which seemed to diffuse a rustic odour through Betsy’s drawing-room;
now that Eline was full of tales about the Horze, about Théodore and Truus and the
children, about the Howards and the little van Ryssels, Betsy perceived that Madame
van Raat was right—that Eline was <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>the charm of her house. Now Betsy herself commenced to look forward with some misgiving
to the time when Eline would leave her, and that misgiving greatly softened her ordinary
acerbity. Otto, whom she formerly thought too formal and affected, she thought charming,
now that she frequently saw him, for she had insisted that he should often come to
dinner.
</p>
<p>At table the conversation once more grew lively and cheerful, quite different from
the slow, dragging discourse between herself, her husband, and Vincent. To Eline her
manner became gentle, out of gratitude for the old pleasantness which she had brought
back with her, and they held endless consultations about Eline’s <i lang="fr">trousseau</i>, which it was now time to see about, if she wanted to marry in the coming winter.
Their afternoons they spent together with dressmakers and in shops; they travelled
together with Otto to Brussels, where Eline wanted to order her wedding-dress, rich
but simple, nothing but white satin, without lace or furbelows.
</p>
<p>Eline in the meantime, in all this stir and bustle, had little time left her for thinking,
and only in the evening did she get any rest. In the evening they often stayed at
home. It was September. Scheveningen gradually lost its attractions, and now that
Otto came to dinner it generally grew late without their noticing it. She sat with
him in the garden, or in the violet boudoir, and she became quite used to her calm
happiness; it seemed in fact as if she had never known anything different. Everything
was so restful and contented within her, that she almost longed for some emotion.
But no, she loved Otto; that single emotion sufficed for her. Never anything but that;
always that calm, always that blue ether!

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Georges de Woude van Bergh studied hard for his examination for Vice-Consul, and one
day Emilie had betaken herself to the Verstraetens’ and had a long talk with Mr. and
Madame Verstraeten, whilst Lili, very nervous and unhappy, had found much comfort
in Emilie. Emilie had laughingly apologized for her unceremonious visit; but really
her aged father was ailing and never went out, and she managed everything for him,
took everything off his hands, even to a request for access for his son. No; she was
certainly not of Georges’ thinking, that one could live without money, and quite understood
that Mr. and Madame Verstraeten also could not harbour such an idea; but after all
the boy had a prospect, had he not? and the pair of them seemed to have so much set
their minds upon that folly, that one could not talk them out of it. The question
really was, had Mr. and Madame Verstraeten any personal objection to him, or would
they permit the two to wait until they could begin life together without too great
a risk of starvation? Would Mr. and Madame Verstraeten be able, at a given moment,
to part with Lili? And if they did not quite refuse, how would they decide? A regular
engagement, or only a—well, a union of hearts, nothing more? It was a pity, certainly,
that the two had made themselves somewhat conspicuous, and that the whole town knew
of it, but they were a pair of unsophisticated children, and in time they would be
more prudent. The question now was—and Emilie summarized her questions once more with
her genial hearty manner, but inwardly a little anxious about the reply.
</p>
<p>And Madame Verstraeten sighed and shook her head thoughtfully; but the old gentleman,
to Emilie’s joy, did not make any insurmountable objections. But still he had his
objections. Lili was so young, such a child; would it not be better if she did not
bind herself yet, and took time to make sure that he was Mr. Right? He liked de Woude
very much; he had noticed too that the boy had something in him; but still, were not
his optimistic financial ideas based rather too much on his love? Had he really no
more wants than now in the blindness of his affection he imagined? He was used to
a certain degree of luxury. Emilie listened attentively, fully convinced of all those
difficulties, about <span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>which she had once spoken to him herself. But now—now she had allowed herself to be
persuaded into the folly of this visit, and she did not want to be faithless to her
boy; now she wanted to make it appear as if all those difficulties merely existed
in Mr. Verstraeten’s mind, and so she would endeavour to remove them. Thus it was
ever. When one had committed one absurdity, one fell from one folly into another,
and now she would be compelled to argue against her own convictions. It was a difficult
task, talk as she might, and it was perhaps to her Georges’ misfortune that she could
plead so well; but dear me, the boy was so smitten, and perhaps after all he was right!
There were other little households that were not rich—small officials, sub-lieutenants.
No, no; at bottom she was really committing an absurdity; but it could not be helped,
it was too late.
</p>
<p>And while she pleaded for Georges, she was inwardly angry that he had brought her
to do such a thing. Could she, then, refuse that boy nothing, and must she herself
be a party to bring about his ruin?
</p>
<p>But she kept her word, and pleaded so well that Madame Verstraeten went to fetch Lili,
who wept bitterly and kissed Emilie fondly. But an engagement was out of the question
for the present. Madame Verstraeten did not care about these poor folks’ engagements,
which sometimes lasted for years, and Emilie declared to Lili that a union of hearts,
sanctioned by her parents, meant much already, under the existing circumstances. It
was better so, after all, was it not? If on further acquaintance they did not suit
each other, there would be no harm done; and if they grew to like each other more
and more—well, so much the better. Come; she should not look at it too gloomily, the
victory gained over the steel-clad hearts of her parents was not an unimportant one.
And what more did she really want? To marry at once—reception to-morrow—in a day or
two to the Stadhuis and the church, and then make their entry in a little attic somewhere!
Yes; that would be very nice!
</p>
<p>Lili laughed between her tears, and kissed her parents; whatever papa and mamma thought
fit, she was satisfied.
</p>
<p>That afternoon Georges was asked to dinner, and after the meal a splendid September
night was spent in the garden. It was late when Georges left; late when Marie and
Lili retired to their room and undressed. Marie listened kindly and patiently to Lili’s
<span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>chattering about hundreds of plans for the future. She would love to travel, and Georges’
employment gave promise of that. Snugly she crept into the cool sheets, smiling at
the rosy visions of her fancy, her arms bent over the little head encircled by its
dishevelled mass of fair hair. Marie too crept into bed, and for a moment all was
quiet in the dark room, when there was a gentle knocking at the door, which the next
moment was opened. The girls started in alarm.
</p>
<p>“Hush, hush! ’tis only me,” whispered a soft, subdued voice, and they saw a small,
bent figure in white night-gown and cap, with a lighted candle in hand, enter the
room. “Hush! I was only coming for a little chat.”
</p>
<p>It was old Dien, the ancient servant of the Verstraetens’, the good-natured old body
who was always so handy when they had parties or <i lang="fr">tableaux-vivants</i>. She approached, treading softly in her stockings, while the candle-light reflected
a yellow glow on her shrivelled, white-capped face.
</p>
<p>“But, Dien, you frighten me! You look like a ghost!” cried Marie.
</p>
<p>“Hush, quiet! They are all in bed; but I thought you wouldn’t be asleep yet. I want
to have a little chat—may I?”
</p>
<p>“Certainly, Dien; certainly you may,” said Lili with animation. “What have you got
to say?”
</p>
<p>Dien seated herself on the edge of Lili’s bed.
</p>
<p>“You can understand, old Dien is not so old but she can tell when there’s something
stirring. And you see, when she does notice it, she can’t keep it to herself; she
must out with it. You little rascal!” She held up her finger to Lili threateningly.
</p>
<p>“What is it, Dien?” asked Lili.
</p>
<p>“Come, deary, now don’t you keep yourself so innocent! Do you think I don’t know why
you cried as you did this afternoon, and why Miss Emilie made such a long stay in
the conservatory? You see I thought there was something then,” she continued, winking
her sunken eye, “and I began thinking to myself, and there you are—at half-past five
in he marches, and stops nicely to dinner, eh?”
</p>
<p>“Get along, Dien; what are you prattling about?”
</p>
<p>“No, no; Dien doesn’t prattle. Dien knows what she knows well enough. And you too,
you know what you’re about.”
</p>
<p>“What is it then?”
</p>
<p>“Well, child, you are quite right. There’s a steady boy he is. <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>Such a nice, gentle little face, with a neat little fair moustache. A proper little
hubby for you. You are rather dainty yourself. They are well matched—eh, Miss Marie?”
</p>
<p>“Cut out for each other,” yawned Marie from between her sheets.
</p>
<p>“You like him then?”
</p>
<p>“Rather!” answered Dien. “And he is always so polite to me and Bet. He always says
it so nicely when I open the door to him: ‘Ah, Dien, how are you?’ Always a word or
two to say, you know. Not a bit proud, and he never forgets to wipe his feet.”
</p>
<p>Lili roared.
</p>
<p>“You aren’t angry because I say so?”
</p>
<p>“No, not at all, Dien; I am very glad he is in your good books.”
</p>
<p>“Sleep you won’t for yet awhile, eh? You see, in the daytime I am always too busy,
and now it’s just a nice time for a snug chat. And Dien may give you a bit of advice,
eh? You see, I have been married too, and it isn’t all honey, child. Yes; at first
you think ’tis very nice to play the wifie, but later on come the youngsters, and
the cares come with them; I have had three of them you see. And what a bother it is
to bring them up! And you know I haven’t had much pleasure of them. One died, a boy,
when he was fourteen, and the other wasn’t quite what he ought to be, and went to
the Indies. Only my girl—yes, she’s a good girl; you know, she’s in Rotterdam, married
to a tailor.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, Dien.”
</p>
<p>“And, I say, when do you think you will marry?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, Dien! really I don’t know yet. We won’t get married for a long while yet, and
you mustn’t chatter about it; do you hear?”
</p>
<p>“No, no; don’t you fear. You see, Bet too, she isn’t blind either. Do you think it
will be a twelvemonth yet?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, quite. But come, Dien, go to bed now.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, deary. But you see, when the youngsters come, those little fair-haired dots—you
are both of you so fair—I shall leave your ma, and come to stay with you. What do
you say to that?”
</p>
<p>“What, as nursemaid? No, thank you, you will be much too old for that then.”
</p>
<p>“Oh! I should wash and scrub them nicely, don’t you fear!”
</p>
<p>“Dien, I think you are saying improper things!” cried Marie. “Fie!”
</p>
<p>“What is there improper in that? But come, I must be off; <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>why, it’s half-past twelve. And do you hear, Miss Marie, you must make haste and have
your turn—that little dot has stolen a march on you; don’t you lag behind now, do
you hear? Will you see to it?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, Dien; I shall do my best,” said Marie.
</p>
<p>“Then dream about it nicely. And you too, deary, you dream about him. And tell him
that Dien thinks him a nice boy, with his little moustache—will you, eh? Will you,
you little rascal?”
</p>
<p>She grasped Lili, who again roared with laughter, jestingly by the shoulders.
</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, Dien, I shall. But you need not shake me like that—ooh! Good-night, Dien.”
</p>
<p>“Good-night, little pets. Hush, child, don’t laugh like that. You will wake the old
folks. Hush, hush! I am going—quiet now!”
</p>
<p>Dien left, looking yellowish-white in the glow of the candle, with a final wink, full
of mystery, her footsteps quite muffled by her woollen stockings.
</p>
<p>“That silly Dien!” lisped Lili, still laughing, and half asleep.
</p>
<p>The room was once more in darkness, and it was quiet, very quiet, and Marie lay with
her head on her pillow, her wide-open eyes fixed on the dark ceiling.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Vincent felt very ill and weak, and his condition became so serious that Dr. Reyer
forbade him to leave his room.
</p>
<p>He followed the doctor’s advice, drinking little, abstaining from smoking, and giving
himself over completely to the soothing influence of the restful atmosphere that surrounded
him.
</p>
<p>His days he passed in Eline’s boudoir, as Betsy could not spare him a sitting-room
to himself. There he would lie down on the Persian divan, an Eastern dressing-gown
snugly wrapped about him—a memento of his days of luxury in Smyrna—his bloodless fingers
clasping a book in which he did not read a line. It seemed to him <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>as though all ideas had vanished from his brain, as if, in fact, his whole being was
fading away in a languid calm, in a sense of weariness like that induced by prolonged
and severe bodily exertion. His mind was filled with petty, childish thoughts, rising
up like bubbles, to burst asunder the next moment. His pleasures were as petty as
his thoughts, and he felt gratified when Dr. Reyer praised him for his obedience,
while he suffered acutely whenever he had to wait a few moments for Eline to bring
him his breakfast. And beyond that he felt nothing; he simply lay down, gazing round
Eline’s room, and counting the pictures, the ferns, and all the smaller objects of
luxury that were scattered about.
</p>
<p>In the morning Eline sat down beside him and read to him or sang a snatch or two from
a favourite opera; and Vincent would lie and listen as in a dream, lost in a strange
vision full of faint odours and subdued tints, all wreathed and entwined one with
another as in a kaleidoscope of colour and perfume. He did not speak, and Eline too
said little, penetrated as she was with a feeling of romantic joyfulness, a joyfulness
such as she had known when keeping her nightly vigil at Aunt Vere’s bedside—the pleasure
of devoting herself to the care of an invalid. She became more and more interested
in Vincent, and the loving care with which she tended him gradually had the effect
of deeply endearing him to her.
</p>
<p>In the afternoon she usually stayed at home until after four, when Otto came to fetch
her for a walk; and then, when he gently rebuked her for not taking sufficient care
of her own health, and for sacrificing herself too much for Vincent, she would look
at him almost tearfully and ask how he could possibly fail to feel the deepest sympathy
for Vincent, who was so forsaken, so unhappy, and so weak. The busy negotiations about
her trousseau with Betsy were somewhat interrupted by these cares, and on one occasion
even she remarked to her sister that she thought it a terrible thing to have to marry
in November, when Vincent would perhaps be dying. She could not help fancying that
Vincent’s illness was caused by a secret passion for her, a passion the secret of
which he had until now most jealously kept. For he had never before made such a long
stay in the Hague; he had now been in the city for nearly a year, whilst he never
used to remain longer than a week or two. Poor Vincent—for the present her watchful
care of him brought him solace and comfort—only, would not all that careful solicitude,
those constant attentions on her part towards <span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>him, feed the flame of that passion that was for ever destined to be so helpless,
as it was only her Otto she might care for, no one else? She would have been glad
could she have confessed those thoughts to another; but to whom could she do so? To
speak to Otto about it, that seemed to her scarcely proper; whilst if she made Betsy
her confidante, she was certain to ask her why she must always fill her head with
such nonsense. How about Madame van Raat though?
</p>
<p>Yes, she was the person to consult; she would call on Madame van Raat one morning
alone, without Otto. But when she did see the old lady, she found it such a difficult
matter to shape her suspicions about Vincent in words, that when her visit came to
an end she had not uttered a syllable of her confession. And she comforted herself
with the sad reflection that Vincent would probably die before they were married,
and that in that case her ministering care would have somewhat sweetened his last
days.
</p>
<p>The days passed by, and in the meantime the suspicion that Vincent cherished a secret
passion for her grew more and more into a certainty, until she began as it were, involuntarily,
to yield herself up to an absorbing pity for her poor ailing cousin. Her happiness,
that had seemed so placid that it could not be broken, glided more and more from the
vain grasp of her fingers, and a sense of nervousness and unrest became daily more
diffused over her being, while in the meantime she lacked the courage to unbosom herself
to Otto; for when she thought of Vincent, a mist appeared to come between herself
and Otto, a mist that grew denser and denser and threatened to part them from each
other. She shuddered at the thought, and after having passed half the day in her nervous
unrest by Vincent’s side, she would long to be again with Otto, in whose placid temperament
she hoped to find a healing balm for her perturbed spirit. Soon after four he came,
they went for a walk together, he returned with her to dinner, in the evening they
often stayed at home, they were much alone together, and when at night he was gone
and she had retired to her room, she had to do her utmost to restrain herself from
bursting into tears, for she found that she no longer drew from his presence that
restfulness and peace which once it had brought her. On the contrary, now and then
his calmness even irritated her, as something indifferent and phlegmatic, which, in
her present mood, brimming over as it was with unrest, repelled her, especially when
she contrasted him with Vincent, in whom she suspected a <span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>world of still, agonizing grief was hidden. Even Otto’s simple ease, beneath which
only so recently she had seen such a wealth of love, irritated her now.
</p>
<p>Would he never then burst forth in a storm of passion, in a tempestuous torrent about—about
anything, whatever it was? Would he ever remain so calm, so placid, so eternally equable?
did he then never feel conscious of something struggling with something else within
his heart, something that boiled and seethed within him, and which must pour itself
forth in a torrent of words? Could nothing move him, nor rouse him from that rest
which seemed all but lethargy? Kind and affectionate, yes, that he was, but he was
incapable of deep feeling; perhaps his calmness was nothing but egoism after all,
an egoism which another’s grief was powerless to move!
</p>
<p>Thoughts such as these made Eline feel wretched and unhappy. Oh, great heavens! they
were the spectres, the grim spectres, that were fast crowding in around her. No, no,
they should <i>not</i> drag her along with them, she would scare them away, away; but in vain, still they
rose up, one after another, chilling her with their icy breaths of gruesome doubts,
and she struggled against them—a fearful struggle! She forced herself to think again
those sweet thoughts which had filled her with an idyllic happiness during her stay
at the Horze; she forced herself once more to find back her placid peacefulness, her
ethereal ecstasy—but alas, it was in vain! And when she began to feel conscious of
that one sleepless night, when a deep silence prevailed throughout the house, and
when she, with great staring eyes, was lying so lonely on her bed; when for the first
time she felt conscious of that, in all its cruel truth, and felt that those days
had passed away for ever, that they would never more smile upon her with their golden
glory of light and joy, then at last she burst out in a wild, tempestuous sobbing,
so tempestuous and wild as she had never sobbed before, and in her passionate outburst
she flung herself upon her pillow as though that were her happiness, as though that
were the bird that slipped through her fingers. She shook her head—no, no, she would,
she must be happy again as before, she would, she would love her Otto, as she did
before in the pine wood—love him! No, it was impossible, it must not, it should not
be—she would, <i>would</i> force herself, with all the strength and energy of her will, to continue to love
him, as she had done hitherto; she would still <span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>cling close to him, as she now clung to her pillow and the gruesome, grinning spectres
should not be able to tear him from her arms. All remained silent in the house; only,
there she heard the big clock in the kitchen down-stairs, tick, tick, unceasingly,
and an intense terror seized her as she listened to that hard, metallic, rhythmic
sound. A terror lest her happiness should not allow itself to be forced back into
her soul; a terror lest some invisible power should push her down, down along some
steep sloping path, while she would fain ascend upward, ever upward. And then followed
a fury, a tempestuous fury, because she felt it so plainly, and yet <i>would</i> not feel, and because she remained too weak to make a strong, decided effort to resist
the encroachment of the unseen powers that ever seemed to mock and taunt her.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The next morning Eline went early to see Vincent; she wanted to hand him a big letter
that had come for him. He was lying as usual in his Turkish dressing-gown on the divan.
Still, slowly and gradually, he was recovering; Dr. Reyer had even told him that he
might take a little walk, but the rest had become dear to him, and he answered that
he did not yet feel equal to walking. When Eline entered he gave her a friendly nod;
he had grown used to her thousand little cares, and he felt grateful to her for them,
and this gratitude brought a kindly glow into his eyes which Eline mistook for love.
She handed him the letter and asked how he felt.
</p>
<p>“Pretty well. I am getting on gradually,” he said wearily, but suddenly he raised
himself up and quickly tore open the envelope. Eline was about to sit down at the
piano.
</p>
<p>“Ah, at last!” she heard Vincent exclaim almost joyfully.
</p>
<p>“It is from New York, from Lawrence St. Clare!” said Vincent, quickly reading through
the letter. “He has found something for me—a place at a good business house.”
</p>
<p>Eline felt suddenly alarmed.
</p>
<p>“And what do you think of doing?” she asked. “What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>“To go as soon as I am better, but—but I am not, and I am afraid I shall not be yet
awhile,” he concluded languidly.
</p>
<p>“To go where—to America?”
</p>
<p>“Yes—certainly.”
</p>
<p>“Are you glad you can go, then?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Of course; why should I hang about here any longer now that I can get a situation?”
</p>
<p>He scarcely thought of what he said. He fell back in the Persian cushions, and a maze
of bright-hued visions rose before his mind. He remembered his former life of endless
change, of ever-changing perspective and glimmering horizon—change was life, change
it was that would cure, that would rejuvenate him.
</p>
<p>Eline, however, felt deep pity for Vincent. Yes, indeed, he was very pleased that
he could go, before her wedding most likely, so that he need not be witness of what
to him was probably a very painful sight. Yes, indeed he loved her—and suffered accordingly.
</p>
<p>“Vincent,” she said at last.
</p>
<p>“Well?”
</p>
<p>“Vincent, really—just think about it, don’t be too rash—you are still so weak. Suppose
you should have a relapse? Ask Reyer’s advice first.”
</p>
<p>“But, Elly, haven’t I always been as I am now? I never was robust, and—and you don’t
want to keep me; besides, and what if I do stay here?” he asked with a smile.
</p>
<p>To her that smile seemed sad and forced, and she reproached herself for endeavouring
to keep him there. No, he must go; only, maybe perhaps things would change—change
so that he need not go at all. She felt giddy, and it all began to dance and shimmer
before her eyes—the thought that rose to her mind, she dared not think. It would be
too terrible. Too terrible for Otto, too terrible also for herself. That day, when
Otto came, Eline felt, instead of the usually so grateful warmth which his presence
had at one time called forth in her heart, nothing but an icy indifference. Oh, God,
how did that come about, how did that warmth chill down like that? She did not know,
but so it was, and she had not the power to change it. She gave him a friendly nod,
and held out her hand to him. She could not look him in the face, but her heart was
deeply moved with pity. There he stood, Otto, by her side, his gentle, kindly glance
fixed upon her, her hand in his, as he leaned against the back of her chair. Yes,
there he stood by her side, he full of love, and she—she felt nothing but cold, chilly
indifference! No, a thousand times no! it might not, it should not be, she would force
herself, she pitied him too much.
</p>
<p>“Nily—what is the matter, child?” he asked softly, as he felt the nervous, pressure
of her fingers on his hand.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Oh—nothing—nothing, only a headache, I think,” she answered faltering, and she looked
at him for the first time that afternoon. His eyes looked deep into hers, and she
was on the point of flinging herself in wild remorse on his bosom, to cling to him
and never to release her hold. But again that unseen power withheld her.
</p>
<p>“Is it no longer to be forced back? Will it never come?” she thought hopelessly. They
remained alone, and it was some little time yet before dinner should be ready.
</p>
<p>“Nily—little woman, tell me, aren’t you well?” he asked anxiously. “Your hand is cold.”
</p>
<p>“I am a little feverish—we have been out driving in an open carriage with Vincent.”
</p>
<p>“I hope you are not going to be ill.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, no; it will pass over.”
</p>
<p>She looked at him smilingly, and all at once, in a rush of despair, she flung both
her arms round his neck.
</p>
<p>“You are so kind, so loving,” she whispered in a broken voice. “You are so kind, and—I
am so fond, so very fond of you.”
</p>
<p>Vincent did not yet feel strong enough to join them at dinner that day. At table Betsy
was telling Otto of the letter from America; Vincent was about to get a situation
in New York.
</p>
<p>“And when does he intend to go?”
</p>
<p>“As soon as he is better. I shall be thankful enough when he is gone.”
</p>
<p>Eline could no longer contain herself.
</p>
<p>“Reyer says he must not think of such a thing for some weeks yet!” she said sharply,
with an angry glance at Betsy. “But of course——”
</p>
<p>“Of course what?”
</p>
<p>“If it were not for the sake of decency, you would, ill as he is, turn him out of
doors.”
</p>
<p>“If I could—yes, I should certainly. And once for all, this I tell you, he shall never
come here again. Fancy hanging about here like this!”
</p>
<p>“But, Betsy—he is nearly dying!” cried Eline, trembling with rage.
</p>
<p>“Oh, nonsense!”
</p>
<p>“What’s nonsense? If you saw him as I do,” she screamed.
</p>
<p>“Never mind, Eline, don’t let us fall out about Vincent. The fellow isn’t worth it.
Why, you make a melodrama of it. Don’t make such an exhibition of yourself, for goodness’
sake.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Yes, I know; ‘Don’t make an exhibition of yourself.’ That’s what I always get treated
to when I show a little feeling. But you—you have no heart—you——”
</p>
<p>“Eline,” said Otto softly.
</p>
<p>Gerard was coming in with the joint. The silence was painful.
</p>
<p>“You have forgotten the gravy, Gerard,” said Betsy.
</p>
<p>Gerard left the room.
</p>
<p>“Yes, you—why you would tread a person underfoot if he were only ever so little in
your way, if he upset you in the least in your brutal egoism! You think of no one
but yourself, and you can’t even understand that everybody else is not equally despicable,
and——”
</p>
<p>“Eline!” said Otto again, as Gerard was coming in once more, this time with a gravy
tureen.
</p>
<p>“Oh, hold your tongue<span class="corr" id="xd31e3915" title="Not in source">,</span> do, with your ‘Eline! Eline!’ <span lang="fr">Qu’est-ce que me fait cet homme! Betsy ne veut pas le voir—mais je t’assure, que Vincent
se meurt. Il s’est endormi dans ma chambre, pâle comme un linge, essoufflé par la
fatigue, que lui a causé cette stupide promenade recommandée par Reyer. Et c’est pour
cela, que je ne veux pas souffrir, qu’on l’accuse d’indiscrétion et de tout cela.
S’il ne fut pas si malade, il ne resterait pas longtemps chez nous—j’en suis sure …!</span>”
</p>
<p>She spoke passionately, with eyes aflame with rage, and the French words fell from
her lips sharp and cutting as needles, haughty and savage.
</p>
<p>Betsy, too, was boiling with rage. Gerard left the room, but she made no reply and
restrained herself.
</p>
<p>“Nily, dear,” said Otto, “I bear Vincent no ill-will, although I don’t feel much sympathy
with him, but still I shall be glad too when he is gone.”
</p>
<p>“Indeed—you too, eh?” she hissed.
</p>
<p>“May I finish?” he resumed, clasping her icy hand in his. “Yes, I shall be glad when
he goes, at least if his presence in the house is able to excite you like this. You
are quite beside yourself. You don’t know what you are saying, Nily; at least not
with what force you are speaking.”
</p>
<p>His quiet words drove her frantic.
</p>
<p>“And you—you—with your eternal calmness, your eternal phlegmatic calmness!” she burst,
nearly shrieking, as she rose from the table and flung down her serviette. “It drives
me mad—that <span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>calmness! Great heavens, it drives me mad! Betsy crushes me with her egoism, and you
with your calmness—with your calmness, yes, your calmness! I—I—I can’t bear it any
longer—it suffocates me!”
</p>
<p>“Eline!” cried Otto.
</p>
<p>He rose and grasped her wrists, and looked her straight in the eyes. She expected
something very terrible, that he would fling her down, strike her. But while he continued
to hold her hands he only shook his head slowly, and his voice sounded full of sorrow,
as he simply said—
</p>
<p>“Eline!—for shame!”
</p>
<p>“Great God! I—I am going mad!” she screamed in a fit of sobbing, and she tore herself
away from his grasp, and rushed out of the room, as she went, dragging some glasses
from the table, which fell with a tinkling noise in shatters on the ground.
</p>
<p>Betsy trembled with rage, and wanted to run after Eline. Otto, however, stayed her.
</p>
<p>“Let her be, I beg of you!” he entreated.
</p>
<p>Henk too had risen, and when Gerard came in they all three felt very much confused
before the servant, about the abruptly interrupted dinner, and about the shattered
glass.
</p>
<p>“Never mind—never mind, Gerard!” said Betsy almost humbly, “never mind. Clear the
table.”
</p>
<p>It was impossible for them to assume a nonchalant air. Gerard must have noticed that
there was something wrong, though his face remained ever so calm and dignified.
</p>
<p>Eline in the meantime had rushed up-stairs into her bedroom and thrown herself on
her bed. Then she began to sob—but Vincent must not hear it. She sobbed and sobbed
until it grew dark; then she heard Vincent walking in the adjoining room, but she
lay still and wrung her hands and choked the sobs in her bosom.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Otto had sat down in the drawing-room, and was staring with moist eyes on the ground
when Henk entered. He noticed a tear in Otto’s eye, and Henk was roused from his wonted
quiet kindliness, and began to boil within him.
</p>
<p>“Erlevoort!” said he, and laid his hand on Otto’s shoulder.
</p>
<p>Otto lifted up his head.
</p>
<p>“Erlevoort! come, old chap, be a man! Sissy is sometimes an awkward little craft to
manage, but she is not bad at heart! You <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>must not take notice of what she said to you, do you hear? She was only angry with
Betsy, because she rather likes Vincent, and so by accident you got your share of
it. But you must take no notice of it. That’s the best way to punish her.”
</p>
<p>Otto did not answer; his mind was too much filled with doubt that Henk’s kindliness
could have cheered him. He recollected how he had once told Eline that she had but
one single fault, that she did not know herself, that there were hidden treasures
within her, that he would arouse those latent gifts, but now he saw but too well that
he had not the power to do so, that he only irritated her, and—that he drove her mad!
</p>
<p>“She can be confoundedly hasty at times!” resumed Henk, as he walked inwardly enraged
up and down the room. “But any one whom she likes, and whom she can look up to, can
lead her easily enough, and then—Shall I go and have a talk to her?”
</p>
<p>“I should—let—her be!” replied Otto, speaking with difficulty. “I dare say she will
herself——”
</p>
<p>He tried to think himself in her place, and to guess how she now felt. But it was
in vain, he could not think, he still smarted too much under the blow she had given
him. Never had he heard her utter such words before, in that strident, shrieking voice;
never before had he seen her features so distorted—even to ugliness—by her passions;
and try as he might, he could not collect his thoughts under that great torturing
grief that cut him to the quick.
</p>
<p>It pained Henk to see his weary, hopeless attitude. And suddenly he felt himself nerved
to action. No, he would not permit it, that Eline should thus treat Otto with contempt,
he would not permit it. With a firm and elastic step he left the room. Henk went up-stairs
and entered Eline’s boudoir. He found no one there, for Vincent, tired as he was after
his first trip, had already gone into his bedroom, quite unconscious of the storm
that had been raging down-stairs. Henk knocked at Eline’s door.
</p>
<p>“Eline!” he called.
</p>
<p>There was no answer, and he quietly opened the door. On the floor lay Eline, her slight
form quivering with inaudible sobs, her face hidden in her hands. He waited for a
moment, but she did not move.
</p>
<p>“Eline, get up!” he said curtly, almost commandingly.
</p>
<p>Savagely she lifted herself up, and savagely she shrieked—
</p>
<p>“What is it? What do you want here? Go away.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Get up.”
</p>
<p>“I won’t; go away, go away! I tell you, go away!”
</p>
<p>He bent over her and grasped her wrists, full of a passion that made the blood rush
to his face. He hurt her, and she gave a cry of pain.
</p>
<p>“Confound it! Will you get up?” he hissed between his teeth, almost beside himself
with rage, while he drew her up savagely. His flushed face, his flaming eyes, and
hissing voice terrified her. Falteringly she let him pull her from the floor.
</p>
<p>“What do you want?” she asked once more, but calmer this time, and with apparent haughtiness.
</p>
<p>“I shall tell you what I want. I want you to go at once—at once, do you hear—to Erlevoort
and ask his pardon. Perhaps you don’t remember what you have been saying in your mad
passion, but you have offended him deeply, you have insulted him. Go, and at once!”
</p>
<p>She looked at him in much alarm. His determined, commanding tones made her tremble,
and she was speechless with terror as she saw him, with his big powerful form, pointing
to the door.
</p>
<p>“You will find him down-stairs in the drawing-room. Are you going now?”
</p>
<p>She trembled all over, but she would not let him triumph.
</p>
<p>“I won’t.”
</p>
<p>“If you won’t, I shall drag you down the stairs until you lie at his feet. I swear
I shall do it, I swear I shall!” he hissed syllable by syllable into her face.
</p>
<p>She stepped back in alarm.
</p>
<p>“Henk!” she cried, shocked that he durst say such a thing to her.
</p>
<p>“Are you going?”
</p>
<p>“Yes—yes, I will go, but—Henk! Oh, don’t, don’t speak like that to me! Why should
you? Great heavens! am I not unhappy enough already?”
</p>
<p>“That is your own fault, your own doing, but that is no reason why you should make
another unhappy too, especially Erlevoort.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, you are right,” she sobbed, quite broken at last. “I will go, but come
with me, come with me, Henk.”
</p>
<p>He supported her as he took her from the room and led her down the stairs. But when
she entered the drawing-room she felt frightened. There was no one there but Otto,
who was seated <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>on the sofa, leaning his head in his hands. For a moment she stood still, undecided
what to do, but Henk looked at her, and his glance and also the sight of Otto’s silent
despair caused her to hesitate no longer. She fell on her knees before him and wanted
to say something, but she was unable to utter a single word for violent sobbing, which
at length seemed to melt away in a copious stream of tears. She laid her throbbing,
glowing head on his knees, and took his hand, and sobbed and sobbed until her heart
nearly broke. He did not speak either, and looked her deep in the eyes.
</p>
<p>At last, with a great effort, she could just say, while Henk remained standing like
her judge behind her—
</p>
<p>“Forgive me, Otto, forgive me, forgive me.”
</p>
<p>He nodded his head, slowly and softly, not quite satisfied with her remorse, feeling,
so to speak, disappointed with something in her manner, which was not what he had
expected, but he bent over her, drew her towards him, and kissed her forehead.
</p>
<p>“Forgive me, Otto, do forgive me.”
</p>
<p>He softly clasped his arm around her, and pressed her for a moment to his bosom, while
she still continued her sobbing, and he closed his eyes in order to prevent the tears
from penetrating through his eyelashes. For he knew it, he felt it—it was all over.
</p>
<p>The evening passed by somewhat gloomily, although Henk, in his frank, kindly tones,
assured him that it was all right again. Of Eline he took his leave with a sad smile.
Eline then begged Betsy’s pardon in presence of Henk. Betsy gave her a little nod
of approval and said nothing. And afterwards when Henk told her how he had forced
her to go to Erlevoort, she looked at him almost with admiration—for she would never
have thought that in a struggle with Eline her husband would prove the stronger of
the two.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Some weeks sped by, and day by day Eline found herself more and more unhappy, for
she felt that all was over, that she could not force herself to love Otto, and she
nearly died with grief under the reproach of his sad smile. And one afternoon she
kept her room, and told Mina to say that she was ill, and was not coming down-stairs.
Otto asked if he might come and see her in her room, but she sent word that she was
tired and needed rest. And gradually, but distinctly, a determination became fixed
in her mind: <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>she must do it, she owed it to his happiness and her own. The next day she would not
receive him either, much as Henk urged her to do so. She only shook her head slowly;
she could not do it. She was ill. Reyer? No, she did not want him. And she kept to
her room, while Otto dined down-stairs with Betsy, Vincent, and Henk, and left early.
</p>
<p>That evening she remained for a long time lying on her sofa, staring into the darkness.
At last she lit the gas, closed the curtains, and sat down at her writing-table. It
must be. Calmly and determinedly she commenced to write, stopping every now and then,
and reading every word to herself—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first salute">“<span class="sc">My dearest Otto</span>,
</p>
<p>“Forgive me, I beg of you, but it cannot be otherwise. Ask yourself the question if
I can make you happy, or if I would not make your life a burden to you. I thought
I could have made you happy, and that thought I shall always cherish, for it has comprised
my greatest happiness in the past. But now——”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>As she wrote the words the tears started to her eyes, and suddenly she burst into
a violent sobbing and tore up the paper. She did not feel capable of giving him such
pain. Great God, she could not do it! But what then should she do? Let matters rest
where they were until perhaps in the end some catastrophe occurred to compel a parting?
No, no, a thousand times better to part in friendship with a last sad farewell! But
already she had caused him so much pain against her will, she wished in future to
give him as little pain as possible, and now—oh! to be swayed thus to and fro in such
a struggle as that, alone and forsaken, without any one to support her, without really
knowing what she wanted or what was her duty! She was too weak for it, for such a
struggle as that. She took up a fresh sheet of paper, however, and once more began
to write—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first salute">“<span class="sc">My dearest Otto.</span>”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>A few lines followed easily enough, very similar to the first letter which she had
torn up. But how should she tell him further, how? Still, all at once her pen rushed
along over the paper, savagely forming as it went letters that were all but illegible,
but still she wrote on page after page of wild, almost incoherent sentences, in which
she over and over again bitterly reproached herself for the <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>way in which she had treated him, and finally released him from his engagement. The
long, rambling letter, full of repetitions, and blurred with her tears, she concluded
with the pathetic prayer that when one day he should have found a girl who was worthy
of him, and who would love him disinterestedly, he would still not quite forget her.
Her whole being went out to him in that final entreaty.
</p>
<p>“Then think sometimes of me, without hatred or bitterness, and have a little pity
for your poor Nily.”
</p>
<p>The letter was written, the envelope sealed, and after much painful hesitation she
at length summed up courage to ring for Gerard, to whom she handed it to post. Then
a wild terror seized her, and she had a sensation as of icy water running down her
back.
</p>
<p>Now Gerard was in the street, she thought, now he had reached this house, now that,
now he approached the letter-box in the Nassaulaan. And it seemed to her as if she
could hear the letter falling into it with a thud, like that of a coffin falling down
an open grave. She was on the point of swooning away, for in the terribly overstrung
state of her nerves, it seemed to her as though she were surrounded on all sides by
tangible terrors and hideous spectres. And all at once, as if awakening from a nightmare,
she felt conscious of what she had done, a deed that was irrevocable! She felt herself
trembling and quivering all over as in a fever. To-morrow, to-morrow early, Otto would
receive the letter, that letter.
</p>
<p>Great God, it must not, it could not be! It was her very happiness that she had flung
away, because the rest and the peace of that happiness had bored her! Yes, it was
her happiness which she had cast away, and which she could never regain.
</p>
<p>It seemed to her as though the ceiling would come down and crush her, she could scarcely
breathe. And she rushed with faltering steps to the door, out of her room, across
the landing and into Betsy’s bedroom.
</p>
<p>“Great God—Betsy—Betsy!” she screamed with a choking voice. Betsy was in bed and awoke
with a fright. A confused idea of something terrible, a thought of fire, of murder,
arose to her mind.
</p>
<p>“Who! What! What is it? What is it, Eline?”
</p>
<p>“I—oh, great heavens—oh!——”
</p>
<p>“What is it, then? What is it, then, Eline?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I have—I—have——”
</p>
<p>“Well?”
</p>
<p>“Sent a—letter to—Otto.”
</p>
<p>“A letter?”
</p>
<p>“I have—I have written him. I have—broken it off. Oh, great heavens!”
</p>
<p>Betsy had sprung out of bed, and she stood trembling before Eline, who had crouched
down on the floor, and lay sobbing hysterically, her face hidden by her dishevelled
hair.
</p>
<p>“What do you say?” she asked, completely crushed.
</p>
<p>Eline said nothing more, she could only sob.
</p>
<p>Henk came in.
</p>
<p>“What is the matter?” he asked anxiously.
</p>
<p>“Eline has written to Otto, she has broken it off!” said Betsy in a tremulous voice.
</p>
<p>Henk stood still in blank amazement, and could not utter a word. But Eline lifted
up her head, and wringing her hands and nearly delirious with grief, she said—
</p>
<p>“Yes, oh heavens! yes, I have broken it off. A long letter—I have sent him—and, oh!
’tis terrible—’tis terrible—but I don’t know what I am doing, I don’t know what I
want, I don’t know if I care for him or if I don’t, or if I care for any one else.
I don’t know anything—and, oh! ’tis all a-throbbing, a-throbbing in my head. I wrote
him—because—because I thought it was my duty—I should have made him unhappy. But it
is terrible, terrible—that I should have done it. Perhaps I ought not to have done
it, perhaps I could have yet cared for him. Oh, God! I would it was all over with
me now, I would I were dead, for I can bear it no longer, I can bear it no longer!”
</p>
<p>Dull and lifeless the words fell from her, while she crouched down on the floor, wrung
her hands, and slowly rubbed her forehead on the carpet.
</p>
<p>Betsy glanced at Henk: what should she do? The secret spite she felt against her sister
melted away for the moment in a great pity at the sight of Eline’s grief. And when
she saw her husband continue staring like one demented at Eline, she felt annoyed
that he could find nothing better to do. She lit the gas, and wrapped a cloak about
her—and Eline’s altered features alarmed her, now that she sat staring vacantly before
her with her eyes red with weeping, her hands folded on her knee.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Oh, Elly, Elly! How could you do such a thing?” said Henk in a husky voice, as he
thought of Otto.
</p>
<p>Eline did not answer, and only slightly moved her head.
</p>
<p>“Oh, my head is bursting!” she faintly murmured.
</p>
<p>“Are you in pain?” asked Betsy.
</p>
<p>“Oh!” groaned Eline.
</p>
<p>Betsy dipped a handkerchief in some water and bathed Eline’s face, her temples, and
her forehead, from which she brushed away the dishevelled hair.
</p>
<p>Henk had sat down. He did not know what to do, what to say; he only saw Otto before
him.
</p>
<p>“How could she do it? How could she do it?” That was his only thought.
</p>
<p>“Is it better now?” asked Betsy gently.
</p>
<p>Eline smiled contemptuously.
</p>
<p>“Better—no—but it is cool—the water——”
</p>
<p>“Will you have something to drink?”
</p>
<p>“No, thank you.”
</p>
<p>She sobbed no longer, but her tears still flowed. And slowly, almost inaudibly, staring
vacantly all the while, she said—
</p>
<p>“Oh, not to know what to do—not to know—and then to do a thing like this, against
your will. Poor, poor fellow! And this terrible pain—oh God!—it is as if I am going
mad.”
</p>
<p>“Come, Eline,” said Betsy, “let me take you to your room.”
</p>
<p>She led Eline away like a child, and like a child she undressed her.
</p>
<p>“Oh, my head!” groaned Eline, and she fell back exhausted on her pillow. Betsy undressed
her further and covered her, then she bathed her face once more with a wet cloth.
</p>
<p>“Come, try and sleep a little now. There is nothing more to be done for the present—perhaps
it will all come right again later on.”
</p>
<p>Eline shook her head.
</p>
<p>“Shall I sit down by your bed?”
</p>
<p>Eline did not answer, and lay staring vacantly before her. Betsy closed one of the
red curtains and sat down.
</p>
<p>The little white night-lamp glowed like a star on the table, and in the panelling
of the wardrobe, in the toilet glass, over the flask and vases, on the muslin toilet
duchesse, fitful gleams of light played hither and thither, while the big, black shadows
lay about everywhere, motionless and gruesome, like so many dark spectres. <span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>Betsy sat shivering in her dressing-gown; she wanted to think, but could not, for
continually the one idea returned to her mind, that Eline had written to Otto. The
hours dragged slowly by, and Betsy heard it strike one, half-past one, two o’clock.
Then the groaning behind the bed-curtain died away. Betsy rose, and peeped through
for a moment; it seemed Eline was asleep, she lay motionless with closed eyes. Slowly
and quietly Betsy left the room.
</p>
<p>In his own room Henk was still seated, leaning his head in his hands. Neither of them
went to bed, and they sat whispering together, now and then listening whether any
movement could be heard in Eline’s room. They both feared something indefinable, of
which they could not speak, something that continually filled their thoughts with
a vague, dread terror.
</p>
<p>“Hush!” cried Betsy all at once, for Henk was still whispering, and she heard something.
Both listened. From Eline’s room there came the sound of a violent sobbing, the sobbing
of a soul in despair, passionate and loud. A chill trembling came over Betsy.
</p>
<p>“I am so frightened,” she faltered in a quivering voice.
</p>
<p>Henk left the room as quietly as possible, and walked across the dark landing. The
servants were in bed, the whole house was in darkness. In Eline’s sitting-room, however,
the gas was alight. There he sat down, and he heard Eline in the adjoining room—she
was sobbing, sobbing with such intensity as he had never heard any one sob before;
it sounded hoarse, screeching, wild, as the voice of a sorrow that was past comforting;
every sob must pain and torture her, every sob re-echoed in his own brain; with every
sob he waited for the following. At last the sobbing died away in a soft groaning,
then it ceased altogether. All was still. And Henk’s hair began to stand on end in
his terror at the tragic stillness that now reigned throughout the big house. He rose,
he was no longer master of his actions, he wanted to be certain, he must see. For
a moment, but for a moment only, he hesitated to enter Eline’s bedroom; then he opened
the door and entered.
</p>
<p>On the rumpled bed, in the ruddy reflection of the curtains, lay Eline with distorted
features, her hair falling a dishevelled mass about her head. The blankets she had
cast aside. She seemed to sleep, but yet every moment an inward sob appeared to shake
her very frame as with a shock of electricity, and under her eyes there were two deep,
dark circles. Henk looked at her, and his lips trembled with emotion at the sight
of that painful sleep. Gently he <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>covered her with the blankets, and he felt that she was very cold. A little longer
he stood staring at that tear-stained face, then he passed through the boudoir, where
he turned down the gas. And then that same tragic stillness filled the dark house
completely, that night of grief and terror.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the morning Eline’s letter was handed to Otto. He would not give himself the time
to retire to his room, but walked straight into the drawing-room, and throwing himself
on the first seat he came to, he opened the letter. And he commenced reading those
words of grief and remorse. There was no need for Eline to assure him that she had
suffered, suffered intensely in the writing of it. Thus much he read in every word,
and with every word a fresh dart of sorrow was plunged into his breast. He read too,
although she did not write it in so many words, that every effort on his part to find
his own happiness in her love—even if he succeeded in once more calling her affections
into being for him—would be in vain; the lesson that he read from her letter, in language
which to him was clear and unmistakable, was that they were separated for ever, because
she had not possessed the strength to preserve her love. A great, an immeasurable
despair filled him; he thought that had she had the strength, had she remained true
to him, he could have made her happy, because in the restfulness of his own soul,
in the soothing calm of his own love, she would have closed her eyes and slumbered,
to awaken again at last full of peaceful happiness. Once he had felt certain that
such would have been their future; now, however, that idea appeared to have been but
an idle fantasy, nothing more.
</p>
<p>Once again he looked through the letter, and it seemed to him as though only then
did he read it aright; yes, she was lost to him, lost forever! A void, a hopeless
vacuum surrounded him in his solitude in the midst of the luxurious drawing-room,
full of inanimate lustre, full of big, chill mirrors and costly furniture, and with
his moistened <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>eyes he looked around him and shuddered. Then he fell back on his chair, and covered
his face with his hands, and a single, painful sob escaped his pent-up bosom. He felt
a sensation as if everything within him was being shattered and broken, as if that
single bitter sigh, like the breath of a hurricane, had dispelled and destroyed every
budding blossom of hopefulness with him—it seemed to him as if with him there was
nought left but that great, that immeasurable despair, and at that moment he would
fain have died. Softly he sobbed and sobbed, and a feeling of bitterness arose in
his breast. Had he deserved this, he who had once discovered such a treasure in himself,
he who had desired nothing better than to make another share that treasure, that treasure
of peace and rest? His treasure was despised, and now he felt himself poorer even
than the poorest, and empty, utterly empty, in despair and lassitude.
</p>
<p>The door was slowly opened. It was Mathilde. She approached him as a sad image of
pity, she sat down beside him, and tried to remove his hands from his face. He started
violently, and looked at her with two great, wildly staring eyes.
</p>
<p>“What have you come to do here?” he asked in a disconsolate voice. For there was nothing
to do for him, nothing; he was dead to everything.
</p>
<p>“What used you to come to me for, five years ago, when you used to sit down beside
me and draw me close to your side? And what did you come to me for one evening, also
five years ago now, when my husband—had—left me—my husband, whom I have never seen
since. Tell me, what did you come to me for then? Did I then ask <i>you</i> what you ask me now?” she said reproachfully. “You have had a letter from Eline,
I know it, I have seen the envelope. You need not tell me what it was about. I can
feel it instinctively. But, Otto, let me share your grief, do not turn a deaf ear
to my pleading.”
</p>
<p>She saw his chest heaving under the mighty sob which he repressed with a violent effort,
and she threw her arm round his neck, and forced him to lean his head upon her shoulder;
and in his own sorrow he started, terrified at the recollection of hers, of her grief,
of which she never spoke, and he felt that indeed she must sincerely desire to comfort
him, when for his sake she thus plunged herself anew into that great sorrow of the
past.
</p>
<p>“Why do you speak about that?” he asked, for he knew that she suffered least when
she suffered in silence.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>“So that you may feel that I understand you. And so that you may see that I live still,
and must continue to live; and especially to show you that all the grief on earth
is not yours exclusively. Perhaps that idea may comfort you a little.”
</p>
<p>“Oh!” he burst out sobbing, and he clung close to her, and tremblingly handed her
the letter. “There, read! read!” he cried.
</p>
<p>She read the letter, and stroked his hair as if he had been a child. Yes, that was
as it should be, now he no longer forced himself to control his feelings, now he felt
not ashamed, in his obstinate manliness, of his copious tears. And while she read,
she thought of Eline.
</p>
<p>“Did she know what she was throwing away?” she mused. “What would she do if she saw
him thus? Is she not worthy of you, my Otto, my own brother? or is it only that she
is unhappy, unhappy as we are?”
</p>
<p>Madame van Erlevoort came in with Frédérique. They had heard the news from Henk.
</p>
<p>Mathilde lifted up his head.
</p>
<p>“There is mamma!” she said simply, as though she would no longer retain him, now that
another demanded his attention. But when he saw his gentle mother, melting away as
it were in his grief, deepest pity filled his soul. He must comfort her.
</p>
<p>“Mother, mother, do not cry like that! ’Tis not so terrible!” he cried out in despair.
</p>
<p>Frédérique remained standing, leaning against one of the folding doors. Of her they
took no notice whatever. Mathilde, mamma, could soothe and comfort him, but she, she
was of no use to him at all; she was silly, childish, and would not know what to say
to him. She remembered how, one day, long before his engagement, she had spoken to
him about Eline; but now she had nothing to say, absolutely nothing. For, of course,
she did not understand what sorrow was, she herself had never suffered, she had no
feeling, she was a stone.
</p>
<p>“A stone! they think I am a stone!” she repeated softly to herself, and she remained
leaning against the door-post and sobbed inaudibly, disconsolate at the thought that
she could not comfort Otto. She felt a hand on her shoulder, and she turned almost
haughty at being thus misjudged. But when she saw his sorrowful face; those moist
eyes, in which, for the first time, she beheld tears; <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>when she saw those lips trembling under his moustache, and the deep furrows over his
brow, she flung herself, brimming over with pity, on his bosom, and clasping him tightly
in her arms, covered his face with burning, passionate kisses.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Vincent was busy packing, for the next day he would be leaving for London. Henk tried
to make him alter his mind and stay, but only half-heartedly, for he felt well enough
that when Vincent was once away, a great obstacle to the peace of the house would
be removed, and Betsy would no longer be irritated by the presence of a cousin whom
she hated, whom she feared, and whom in her fear of him she had nurtured and tended
until she abhorred him. In the morning before his departure Vincent had a last chat
with Eline in her boudoir.
</p>
<p>“Then you are going, really?” she asked.
</p>
<p>“Certainly, my dear girl. You can see for yourself that Betsy can’t bear me any longer.”
</p>
<p>“What are you going to do in London?”
</p>
<p>“I have to call on some acquaintances there—to arrange some money matters before I
go to America.”
</p>
<p>“Are you going to America, then?”
</p>
<p>“You know I am; haven’t you yourself brought me St. Clare’s letter?”
</p>
<p>“I—I did not know that you had decided for certain. Poor Vincent!”
</p>
<p>He looked at her with a quiet smile; not quite recovered from his weakness, it rather
soothed him to be pitied.
</p>
<p>“Do you pity me so?”
</p>
<p>“Yes—indeed, I pity. You are beginning your wanderings again, and who knows if I shall
ever see you again. Perhaps never, never again!”
</p>
<p>She sighed.
</p>
<p>“I am always happiest when I am on my wanderings.”
</p>
<p>She felt an eager desire to ask him if she might accompany him, <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>if she might by his side also seek her fortune far away. But she did not know how
to shape her question, and she waited to see if perhaps he would say something. For
did he not love her? had he not wanted to go away for her sake? Now there remained
nothing more that need separate them.
</p>
<p>“He is afraid to speak,” she thought, and she could not say whether she was glad or
sorry that he was afraid.
</p>
<p>“Happiest on your wanderings!” she repeated musingly. “It is possible—you are a man,
you <i>can</i> wander. But I am a girl, I have always lived a quiet life here. Happy am I? Heavens!
No, that I am not!”
</p>
<p>He glanced at her for a moment, as if about to ask her something; but for a while
he remained silent. Then he asked—
</p>
<p>“And why—are you not happy?”
</p>
<p>“Why!” she murmured.
</p>
<p>She waited for him to proceed, until perhaps he should put to her the question which
she had awaited for days past. But no doubt it was owing to a sense of honour and
decency that he did not ask it; it was but such a little while ago as yet that she
had written to Otto. Still she thought she could detect the presence of love beneath
his soft accents, and she looked at him. A ray of sunshine glinted along the window-curtain
into the room and fell upon him where he sat, surrounding him with a kind of halo,
and she started back in sudden alarm when she observed by that brilliant light how
he resembled her dead father. This alarm caused her heart to pulse the quicker, and
she fancied that she loved Vincent for the sake of her father’s memory, because in
him she saw a victim of the world’s conventionality, and thus she invested him with
something ideal and romantic.
</p>
<p>He, too, looked at <i>her</i> with pity in his heart, for he knew that she had flung away her happiness. He had
often done so himself, he thought; but in his own case the fact had never disclosed
itself to his eyes with such distinctness as it did now with regard to Eline. For
a moment he wanted to tell her as much, but he could see no use in doing so, and so
he said nothing. She would never have admitted it.
</p>
<p>“Vincent!” she faltered at last, with her nerves painfully overstrung in the suspense
of waiting, waiting for that which never came. “Vincent, tell me—perhaps we shall
never see each other again—have you nothing—nothing to say to me?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I have, and a good deal, Elly dear; I have to thank you for having tended and nursed
me like a dear little girl, here in your own room, at a time when you yourself were
suffering.”
</p>
<p>“How do you know that I suffered?”
</p>
<p>“I have a <i>little</i> knowledge of human nature.”
</p>
<p>She shook her head.
</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. I have not suffered, I pity—Otto, but I have not suffered myself.”
</p>
<p>As she uttered that lie she felt it tortured her, but it was for the sake of Vincent,
who loved her, and who must not know of her own grief. He looked at her penetratingly,
asking himself why it was that she lied, but he was at a loss to account for it, he
could not understand it at all; the only thing he did understand was that in the soul
of woman there always remained something that was strange and mysterious, a mist that
could not be penetrated. Neither did she understand <i>him</i>. She could not understand why he did not ask her to love him, now that there was
nothing more to separate them, and now that he was on the point of going away. In
another hour he would be gone. Oh, perhaps he thought it was too late. She sighed,
and eagerly she said—
</p>
<p>“Vincent, one thing you must promise me; if ever I can do anything for you, write
to me, and I assure you I shall not disappoint you. Will you promise me this?”
</p>
<p>“I promise you, and I thank you.”
</p>
<p>“And something else. I know you are often in want of money. If at anytime I can help
you with any, pray write to me. Just now, for instance, I have two hundred and fifty
florins in cash lying here; are they of any use to you? if so, they are at your disposal.
May I give you the money?”
</p>
<p>She had already risen to open her escritoire, but he grasped her hand with something
like emotion.
</p>
<p>“Elly—Elly—no, Elly—not that—thank you very much. It is most kind of you indeed, but
I could not return you the money for ever so long perhaps.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, come now, don’t—don’t refuse me. ’Tis a pleasure to me, I assure you.”
</p>
<p>“Once again, I don’t know how to thank you, but really—I—I cannot accept it—really
I can’t.”
</p>
<p>She stood still, and her cheeks turned white as marble. Yes, yes, indeed, he loved
her, how could she doubt it? If he did not, would <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>he have refused to accept the money? Yes, she could see it, he would not owe her money,
because he loved her. But why did he not speak then?
</p>
<p>At length he rose, the cab was to be at the door in a few minutes.
</p>
<p>“Now I must really go,” said he. “Good-bye, Elly dear, good-bye; thank you a thousand
times for what you have done for me.”
</p>
<p>“Good-bye, Vincent, good-bye.”
</p>
<p>He made a movement as if he wanted to kiss her, and she threw her arms round his neck
and kissed him on both cheeks.
</p>
<p>“Think of me sometimes, will you? I am fond of you, and I am really not fond of many
persons; I can count my affections easily enough. Well, good-bye, Elly, good-bye,
and perhaps, <i lang="fr">au revoir</i>.”
</p>
<p>Once more she kissed him, her eyes full of tears, and as he went she threw herself
on the sofa, and nodded her head to him for the last time. He disappeared, closing
the door behind him.
</p>
<p>For a while she sat staring at that door. And when, after a few moments, she heard
his cab move away, she wondered that he had kissed her so unreservedly and coolly
in that final moment of parting. She wanted to muse about him, because she did not
understand him; she wanted, too, to probe her own feelings and discover if she really
loved him, but she felt tired and her head ached, and with a weary sigh she fell back
in the cushions, covering her face with her hands.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>It was the third day after Vincent’s departure, but although he had left the house,
there had been another tiff about him between Eline and Betsy, who had spoken her
mind about her “wretch of a cousin” in the presence of visitors, and to Eline’s intense
annoyance. The time had now come, Betsy thought, when she should once for all let
Eline know that <i>she</i> was mistress in that house; and so, with the full intention of doing so, she walked
up-stairs in the evening into Eline’s boudoir.
</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Eline said haughtily. “I should like to be alone.”
</p>
<p>“May I remind you that you are in my house, and that if I feel inclined to come here
I shall do so! I have something to say to you.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Make haste then, for I tell you again I wish to be alone!”
</p>
<p>“<i>You</i> wish! <i>you</i>! What right have you to wish, I should like to know? You are in my house, and it
isn’t for you to wish! Who do you think you are, eh?” shrieked Betsy, exciting herself
to a towering passion. “Do you imagine you are a princess, and can do exactly as you
like? or do you fancy that I am going to be dictated to by you in the presence of
strangers?”
</p>
<p>“Don’t you think I know what to say without your valuable advice? I don’t want your
advice, so there! And I assure you that in future, whenever I hear you speak in that
disgraceful way about Vincent, I shall make you hold your tongue. Thus much I assure
you.”
</p>
<p>“Indeed, you assure me—you do, eh? But I don’t want your assurance, I tell you. I
have no intention to trouble myself in the least about your idiotic tenderness for
Vincent! Perhaps it was he from whom you learnt the politeness to interrupt one among
strangers as you dared to do to me? I can’t understand how you can have the impertinence,
I can’t really. Why, they must have thought you were crazy. Well, if you are, that
must be your excuse! Fancy calling me vulgar; and what are you, pray? you, who forget
the very rudiments of politeness, and have——”
</p>
<p>“Yes, I know, I have heard it before—have had the impertinence to interrupt you, you
were going to say. Do say something else for a change. But you shall see that I dare
more than that, if you attack Vincent again. You think him false, do you? But I think
you are false, you who invite him here yourself, and then drive him out of the house,
you who for no reason whatever go on about him like a washerwoman! It is you, you
who are false!”
</p>
<p>“Keep your beautiful epithets to yourself, please.”
</p>
<p>“Then you just keep that wretched abuse of Vincent to yourself too, please!” shrieked
Eline, boiling with passion. “I won’t, do you hear, I won’t hear it any longer. I
have stood it long enough for the sake of peace, but now I won’t stand it any longer!
Do you understand?”
</p>
<p>“Indeed, won’t you stand it any longer? Perhaps it was all on account of that darling
Vincent that you could not stand Otto any longer either?”
</p>
<p>“Hold your tongue!” screamed Eline.
</p>
<p>“Or perhaps you are smitten with that reptile, and that is why you treated Otto as
if he had been a schoolboy with whom you <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>were having a little joke? You won’t bear my abuse of Vincent any longer, will you?
but I tell you that I won’t be compromised any more by you! Not bad, I’m sure! To
start with, you are silly enough to break your engagement, and, out of pure caprice,
without the slightest reason, you have made yourself the talk of the town; then you
carry on here in my house with Vincent, as if you were in love with him, and as a
wind-up you dare to be impertinent to me before strangers! Well, I am not going to
bear it any longer, do you hear? If you have learnt that unmannerliness in your philosophic
discourses with Vincent——”
</p>
<p>Eline could no longer control herself. Her nerves were strung to their utmost tension,
and quivered under Betsy’s insults as under the touch of rough hands. And Betsy’s
allusion to Otto, to her sympathy for Vincent, which she fancied she had so successfully
concealed, made her furious. She grasped Betsy’s wrists in the nervous strength of
her fingers, and in a voice shrill with rage she cried—
</p>
<p>“It is enough! Hold your tongue, I tell you. Don’t talk any more about Otto, don’t
say another word about Vincent, or I—I—I’ll do you an injury! Don’t aggravate me any
longer. Take care!”
</p>
<p>Betsy wrenched herself free from her grasp.
</p>
<p>“Eline, are you mad?” she cried, but Eline did not allow her to finish. She remained
standing in front of Betsy and clenching her trembling hands.
</p>
<p>“I tell you, you aggravate me, you aggravate me with that eternal rubbish about your
house. ‘My house! my house!’ I know I am in your house, but I did not ask you to take
me in, and I won’t be reminded that I am in your house, as if you did me a charity.
I am not dependent on you although I am in your house, and I won’t be dictated to
by you, not in anything. I am free, quite free, to do just as I please.”
</p>
<p>“Oh no, you are not; you are in my house, and you must behave yourself. And if you
don’t know how to behave yourself, I shall tell you, so long as you are here!”
</p>
<p>“And I won’t be told by you how I am to behave!” shrieked Eline. “I tell you, I am
free! I don’t want your house, about which you make so much fuss, and I swear to you
that I shall not stay another moment in it! That I swear to you, I swear it, by all
that is sacred! Enjoy your house to yourself, or choke in it for my part!”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span></p>
<p>She was scarcely conscious of what she said. She had worked herself into a paroxysm
of rage, and with a rapid movement she picked up her cloak from the floor and flung
it round her shoulders. Then she rushed towards the door, but Henk, who on hearing
the loud voices had come upon the scene, stopped her.
</p>
<p>“Eline!” he began severely.
</p>
<p>“Let me go, let me go!” she screamed like a wounded tigress, and she pushed his big
body aside with such a frantic strength as made him stagger. Once more he attempted
to stop her, but again she pushed him aside, rushed out of the room, and down the
stairs.
</p>
<p>“Eline! In Heaven’s name, Eline! you don’t know what you are doing!” he shouted to
her from the landing, and rushed after her.
</p>
<p>She heard no more. She had but one single thought: to fly from that house, away from
a shelter where she was reproached for her presence. She saw nothing more; she saw
neither Gerard nor the servants, who stood looking at her in blank amazement; she
hurried along the vestibule, flung open the glass doors, and quickly drew the bolt
from the street-door. But now, now she heard behind her a rattling noise; the door
fell to with a bang, shattering the glass on the floor with a loud crash.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then the street-door too slammed behind her, and she found herself in the street.
The rain was falling in torrents, and the blustering wind blew open her cloak, and
beat in her face as with a damp thong. It was impossible for her to plod on in the
teeth of that boisterous hurricane, and she turned the other way and allowed herself
to be driven along aimlessly by the force of the wind, which flew at her back like
a gigantic vampire, with big, tearing claws. Aimlessly she let herself be carried
along in that pitiful, that dismal night. In the street she saw no one, and in her
loneliness, in the lowering gloom, in the splashing downpour, in the wild gusts of
the storm, she at length felt herself conscious of her position, and a chill, indefinable
terror overtook her. It seemed to her as though she had been suddenly wrenched away
from out of the midst of every-day life, and found herself plunged into a sphere full
of nameless, terrible anxiety and blank, dismal despair. She nearly died with fright
at the darkness that enveloped her like a black shroud of grief, at the deluge which
was pouring <span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>down upon her bare head, utterly without protection from the wind gusts which nearly
blew her cloak from her shoulders, and numbed her with cold in the thin black silk
dress that fluttered about her in the buffeting wind. Her little patent shoes went
splashing along through mud puddles and thick mire; her dishevelled hair hung dank
and dripping down her temples; and under her thin cloak she felt a chill moisture
gliding down her neck and down her bare bosom. She knew no longer where she was; she
started in fright at the twigs that fell about her, at the howling of a watch-dog
in a house she passed. And she saw no one, no one.
</p>
<p>But her condition brought her to herself. She felt conscious of having fled from her
sister’s house. She would fain have stood still for a moment to reflect, but the strong
wind thrust her forward, as though she were one of the autumn leaves that were whirled
about her head. And she let herself be blown along, and collected her thoughts, while
tramping forward with involuntarily hurried footsteps. Despite her pitiful condition,
she felt neither remorse nor regret at the step she had taken. And suddenly she felt
astounded at her own courage. She would never have imagined herself possessed of the
pluck to run away in such a night, without knowing whither to go. But she forced her
thoughts to take some practical shape, she could not continue wandering about in this
way, she must have an object.
</p>
<p>All at once she noticed that she had reached the Laan Copes van Cattenburgh. Driven
forward by the wind, she hurried along the rain-sodden, muddy path, while the storm
swept in sullen fury across the Alexanders-veld.
</p>
<p>Continually she had to step back before the shower of loose twigs which the wind blew
from the trees, and she began to perceive that she was in danger of being crushed
by some falling trunk. A fear for her life prevented her from thinking, but the more
intensely that fear numbed her heart, the more eagerly she nerved herself to do so.
Whither in Heaven’s name should she go? A chill tremor seized her—a vague, undefined
dread—while her wide, staring eyes were trying in vain to peer through the dense gloom.
To whom was she to go? To old Madame van Raat? No, no, fond as she was of her, the
old lady would be sure to take the part of her son and her daughter-in-law! To the
Verstraetens—her brother-in-law’s relation? Everything began to surge around her,
and she—she felt herself lost in her black solitude, and gradually <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>sinking lower and lower into an abyss of grief and of mire! Otto’s figure rose to
her mind, and she would have given all that remained her of her life could he have
come to her at that moment, could he have there and then borne her away in his arms,
clinging to his heart, to some abode of warmth, light, love, and safety. Her courage
all but failed her to go farther, she could have flung herself down in that mire through
which she plodded, and remain lying there, letting the winds sweep over her until
her last breath should have escaped her! But no! that would be all too cowardly after
the pluck she had already shown, and now she must, she would set her mind to think
of some place of refuge. Not Madame van Raat—not the Verstraetens—in Heaven’s name
whither should she go then? And all at once, like a lightning flash darting through
the gloom of that night of blank despair, an idea struck her, and her mind reverted
to a certain suite of humble apartments, to Jeanne, her friend of former days. Yes,
thither she must go: she knew no one else, and she could not for ever go on wandering
along in that pouring rain, in that howling storm; and, bracing herself up to face
the buffeting wind, she hurried round—numbed, chill, and wet to the skin—by the Alexanders-veld
in the direction of the Hugo de Grootstraat. There, over on the opposite side of the
field, she could just see the backs, lit up here and there with a faint gas glimmer,
of the houses on the Nassauplein, but she could not distinguish which of them was
theirs—hers no longer. A wild, longing remorse now filled her poor, despairing heart
at the recollection of all she had lost yonder, at the thought that she had yet to
plod on for so long through the raging storm ere she could reach the Ferelyns. And
she was tired, tired unto death, tired from her quarrel with Betsy, tired with the
rain that was unceasingly beating down upon her face, cold and cutting as thongs of
steel, tired with the wind against which she struggled as with an immense black monster,
that was dashing her to and fro as though she had been a human battledore. She felt
more fatigued with every step she took in her little patent shoes, which were bespattered
with mud, and with every movement threatened to slip from her feet. And oh! she could
have died with misery, with distress, with grief.
</p>
<p>But forward, still forward she must go, and she fought and struggled on with the monster
and slowly gained upon it. In this way she reached the Javastraat, and then she turned
to the right, <span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>towards the Laan van Meerdervoort. The hurricane shook her as though it would break
her like a reed, and a heavy branch struck her on the shoulder, and scratched her
face so that she screamed with pain. And suddenly, with despair overmastering her
body and soul, desperate with fear and grief, she made an attempt to start running,
running as if for very life, and fly—fly to the Ferelyns. But the furious wind stopped
her, it was in vain, she could only proceed slowly, painfully, step by step.
</p>
<p>“Oh God! What have I done?” she cried in wild despair. Those familiar streets, along
which she trod almost daily, seemed to her, in that noisome darkness, as the unknown
ways of a demon city along which she was doomed to wander like some accursed phantom.
She passed by Madame van Raat’s house, and she had to summon forth all her courage,
all the strength of her will, not to knock at that door, that would surely open to
her, and admit her to light and warmth. But no, it was too late, Madame would be asleep;
besides, she would reproach Eline with her flight from the Nassauplein. And she plodded
on, driven forward by the wind and by an obstinate fixed idea, towards the house of
the Ferelyns. She went on, on, although with every step she took she felt her thin
little saturated shoes growing heavier, heavier than lead. She turned at the Spiegelstraat—how
much longer should she have to suffer? She counted the minutes—then—then she entered
the Hugo de Grootstraat. And the furious rain beat down more savagely than ever on
her face, more roughly than ever the wind tugged and tore at her cloak, when—thank
God!—she stood at their door. She could see no light anywhere, but she did not hesitate.
Here only could she find safety. And she rang the bell violently, roughly, passionately,
as with a tintinnabulating cry for help.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The time to her seemed unendurably long before any one answered. But at last she heard
steps coming down the stairs, the bolt was drawn with a grating sound, then the door
was slowly, stealthily opened, and a face appeared at the opening.
</p>
<p>“In God’s name!” she cried imploringly, and pushed the door quite open and rushed
inside. “It is I, Eline.”
</p>
<p>The door closed and she stood in the darkness before Frans Ferelyn, who, in utter
amazement, shouted out her name. At the top of the stairs appeared Jeanne with a lamp,
and in her longing <span class="pageNum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>for light, for warmth, for glow, her will once more got the better of failing strength,
and she hastened up the stairs.
</p>
<p>“Jeanne!—Jeanne!—I implore you—help me. It is I—Eline, oh, help me! help me, do!”
</p>
<p>“Great heavens, Eline!” Jeanne cried, as she stood paralyzed with astonishment.
</p>
<p>“Help me, do. I have—run away from them. Help me, do, or I shall die.”
</p>
<p>She sank down soaking wet at Jeanne’s feet, and where she lay the stairs were soon
wet with the water that dripped from her cloak.
</p>
<p>“Great heavens, Eline! Eline!” cried Jeanne, who could not believe her own eyes.
</p>
<p>Eline had burst out sobbing, and remained crouched at Jeanne’s feet. Jeanne attempted
to lift her up; and wherever her hands touched her, she felt her icy cold and soaked
through with the rain.
</p>
<p>“In Heaven’s name, Eline, what have you done? What has happened? You are so wet—so
wet—wet and cold all over. Great heavens, Eline!” She led Eline, who walked with tottering
steps, into Frans’s little office, and set down the lamp. Eline fell exhausted on
a chair, the dirty rain-water oozing through her clothes.
</p>
<p>“Yes—yes,” cried Eline. “I have run away from them, I could not stop with them any
longer. And I have come to you—because I don’t know where else to go. Oh, Jeanne,
do, do help me!” she went on, in a voice broken with sobs.
</p>
<p>Jeanne trembled with nervousness and pity.
</p>
<p>“Tell me about that afterwards, Eline. Let me undress you—you will be ill in these
wet things.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, undress me, do—that cloak, those shoes, oh, I am sick of myself. I am all
over mud. Great heavens! oh, that I were dead!” She threw herself, trembling all over,
backward in her chair. Frans had come into the room.
</p>
<p>“Oh, Frans, just look here,” said Jeanne, shaking with excitement, and pointed to
Eline. “I hope she won’t be ill.”
</p>
<p>“Without a hat, in that thin, low-necked dress! I shall try and light the fire down-stairs.
You undress her.”
</p>
<p>He was still as if paralyzed with Eline’s appearance, and he too trembled with pity,
quite unable to speak, as he saw her sitting in that chair, the water dripping from
her hair on her white face and <span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>down her throat, her black evening dress clinging to her like a wet flannel. But he
went. He must be up and doing.
</p>
<p>And outside raged the storm.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>She was now in their well-lit sitting-room, lying on a couch which Frans had placed
by the side of the flaming stove, and she shivered with fever under her woollen blankets.
And yet she felt a grateful sense of well-being in that light, in sight of those flames,
intensely grateful that she was saved from the demoniac powers of darkness. Suddenly
she raised herself up.
</p>
<p>“Jeanne,” she shrieked in a hoarse voice to the little trembling woman, who was preparing
a steaming hot drink. “Jeanne! I implore you, forgive me for keeping you up such a
night as this. But, in Heaven’s name, where was I to go to? Oh, that rain, that wind!
It drives me mad to think of it. I had no idea that a person could be in such distress
as I have suffered this night. But really, I could not stay with them any longer.
As for that Betsy, oh, how I hate her.”
</p>
<p>“Eline, I entreat you, be calm now.”
</p>
<p>“Why did she mention Otto’s name? What right has she to mention Otto’s name? I hate
her! I hate her!”
</p>
<p>“Eline! Eline!” Jeanne cried, clasping her hands.
</p>
<p>She flung herself before the couch.
</p>
<p>“Eline, I beseech you, I beseech you, in Heaven’s name! Be calm! Rest yourself now,
Eline.”
</p>
<p>Eline, with her feverish, staring eyes, looked long at Jeanne, then she threw her
arm round her neck.
</p>
<p>“Lie down and rest yourself now, Eline; rest yourself, if you cannot sleep.”
</p>
<p>A hollow sob burst from Eline’s throat.
</p>
<p>“Oh, you are an angel!” she whispered in broken tones. “I shall never forget what
you are doing for me, never. It is as if you have rescued me from an abyss of despair.
Oh, that mud! You care for me then, Jany?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, Eline, of course I do; but rest now, rest yourself now.”
</p>
<p>“Oh! rest myself.”
</p>
<p>That single word ‘rest’ cut Jeanne to the quick. Eline pronounced it in a voice full
of despair, as if for her there would never more be any rest. Still she allowed Jeanne
to ensconce her snugly in the pillows, and emptied the glass that Jeanne offered her.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Thanks, thanks, Jany,” she faltered.
</p>
<p>Jeanne covered her up with the blankets and sat down beside her. The windows rattled
in the wind, and the bare branches beat furiously against the glass. The clock over
the chimney struck three.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>It had just struck three, too, in the house of the Van Raats, when Frans Ferelyn drew
up in front of their door in a cab. The storm still roared and shrieked like some
wounded monster that was savagely fighting for life above the housetops of the dark
city. Frans sprang from the cab and rang the bell. He noticed that the gas was lighted
in the vestibule.
</p>
<p>The door was opened immediately by Henk, who appeared to be expecting some one. But
on seeing Frans rush inside, he stepped back in astonishment.
</p>
<p>“Is that you, Ferelyn?” he cried.
</p>
<p>“Yes, don’t be alarmed,” said Frans, calming him, for he saw that Henk was in a terrible
state of excitement. “It is all right; Eline is with us.”
</p>
<p>He walked further inside, crushing the glass that lay scattered all over the vestibule.
</p>
<p>“With you, is she? Thank God!” exclaimed Henk. “I was mad, mad; I did not know what
to do! Thank God she is with you.”
</p>
<p>“Come in, Ferelyn,” came in a trembling voice from Betsy, who appeared at the door
of the dining-room.
</p>
<p>The servants were also in the vestibule, and their frightened faces cleared up a little,
while they retired whispering into the kitchen. Frans entered the dining-room with
Henk.
</p>
<p>“You need not be alarmed, madam; really, for the moment it is all right. Eline was
wet through, but Jeanne has taken her under her care. You can imagine what a fright
it gave us when we heard such a loud knocking at the door, and at such an hour, and
we saw her soaked through.”
</p>
<p>Suddenly he noticed Henk’s face.
</p>
<p>“But I say, what has happened to you? Your cheek is all over blood.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s nothing at all. When Eline ran away I rushed after her, and through the
wind the door in the vestibule fell to and broke the glass. The shattered glass sprang
into my eyes, and so I could not at once run after her. Still, as soon as I could
<span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>I got out into the street with Gerard, to drag her home again if necessary. But it
was so confoundedly dark; the gas-lamps were blown out in the storm, and I could see
nothing of her. I did not know what to do. Then we went to the police-station on the
Schelpkade, and they sent out some night-watchmen to find her. She was in such a state.
I thought perhaps she might have made an end of herself, and in this infernal weather
anything might happen to her. My eye pains me; I shall go and see an oculist to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>Betsy fell down with a sigh in a chair.
</p>
<p>“Oh, ’tis terrible, terrible!” she faltered. “That girl can behave like a maniac sometimes!”
</p>
<p>“Of course, if you do your best to drive her mad!” cried Henk angrily, with his hand
on his eye.
</p>
<p>“Ah, <span lang="fr">bien</span>! Yes, blame me for it.”
</p>
<p>“Van Raat, there is just a thing or two I want to say to you,” interrupted Frans.
“In the first place, I came round here without a moment’s delay, because I feared
you would be terribly anxious about her.”
</p>
<p>“Old chap, I don’t know how I can thank you.”
</p>
<p>“Never mind about that just now. But Eline has positively declared that she would
not go back to you. Now I need not tell you that such an affair as that soon gets
wind; people begin to talk, and all that, and that! not very pleasant. And the servants
know all about it too, don’t they?”
</p>
<p>Betsy gave Frans a grateful look for touching that point.
</p>
<p>“Oh, well, how can you help that?” cried Henk impatiently. “People will always talk.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s true enough; but anyhow you come round to my house as soon as you can
to-morrow, and see if you can’t persuade Eline to return home. That is, of course,
if she is not ill; just now I thought she was rather feverish. So you had better let
her rest a bit now; but come as early as possible to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>“All right,” said Henk, with a dazed look.
</p>
<p>“I believe she was delirious when I went out to fetch a cab, but still she seemed
very determined. She would not go back, and she gave me her keys. She asked me”—and
he looked at Betsy—“to arrange her things here and pack them. But I think she said
it all in her passion; I hope in any case that by this time to-morrow we shall have
come to some amicable arrangement.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Look here, Ferelyn!” said Betsy uneasily; “you can well understand the despair I
am in. Good gracious, it isn’t the first tiff I have had with Eline, but who could
imagine her capable of such a mad freak as this? And as you say, all the Hague will
be talking about it. Therefore if you can manage to persuade her to come back, I shall
be for ever grateful to you. Our house is always open to her; and as for those keys,
you had better leave them here. I am of your opinion, and think it will all come right
yet. Good heavens! what a blessing that she came to you! But in such a night as that,
alone, out in that storm! How could she have done it? Good heavens! How <i>could</i> she have done it?”
</p>
<p>Frans had still to talk about one or two matters with Henk, who asked him to stay
till the morning, as Frans had sent his cab away, and the weather was still frightfully
boisterous. Gerard conducted Frans to Henk’s dressing-room, where he removed his wet
clothes.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Early next morning Henk drove with Frans to an oculist. It was only a vein that had
burst in Henk’s eye, and after a little grain of glass had been removed from it with
a lancet, he felt greatly relieved. But across his cheek there was a long, ugly cut.
</p>
<p>“I look as though I had been in the war,” said he, with an attempt at a smile to Ferelyn,
as soon as they were in the carriage again, on their way to the Hugo de Grootstraat,
“and indeed, old fellow, it does seem as if we were all at war just now. I have got
enough of it already.”
</p>
<p>Ferelyn could not help pitying him when he saw that kindly honest face suffused with
a gloomy melancholy. It was evident enough that Henk looked forward with a deal of
misgiving to the interview with Eline. But the ordeal was spared him. Eline passionately
refused to receive him, and in the adjoining room he sat and listened anxiously to
the reproaches she levelled at Frans. Why did Frans want to bring him? Why had she
given Frans her keys? Was Frans, too, no longer to be trusted?
</p>
<p>Eline’s voice sounded hoarse and rough, and to Henk it seemed that she was delirious.
Then he heard a soft, reproachful whispering of Jeanne, followed by the sobbing of
Eline, who accused herself of ingratitude.
</p>
<p>Soon Frans came back, shrugging his shoulders.
</p>
<p>“She won’t see you. You had better resign yourself to it. I <span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>believe she is in a violent fever. Do you think Reyer is still at home? If so, I should
drive down to him if I were you.”
</p>
<p>“All right,” said Henk dejectedly, “I will go.”
</p>
<p>Eline was still lying on her couch covered with woollen blankets, and she groaned
softly as if in pain.
</p>
<p>“You are so kind to me, Jany, but you see of course I can’t remain here, and trouble
you like this,” she went on, sorrowfully. “You haven’t very much room. I must be an
inconvenience to you. This afternoon I shall go to an hotel.”
</p>
<p>Jeanne sat down beside her and took her hands in hers.
</p>
<p>“Eline, be sensible now, and don’t talk any more about that. Believe me, you are ill;
you remain quietly here with us. I won’t insist that you shall return to Betsy’s,
but then you must not talk about going to an hotel.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, but if I am ill—I don’t believe I am, but you say so—if I am ill, it will be
some time before I can leave you again. And—and—oh, forgive me for saying it—I know
you <i>cannot</i> afford it, Jany dear; forgive me, forgive me for saying it.”
</p>
<p>Jeanne looked at Eline tenderly, and her eyes filled with tears.
</p>
<p>“If it’s that, Eline, pay us then and stay here; pay us, and don’t talk any more about
an hotel. I won’t be ashamed of it; you may pay me for it if you want to. But stay
here—stay.”
</p>
<p>Eline started up with her wild staring eyes and her dishevelled hair, which Jeanne
brushed in vain from her temples. And she clung to Jeanne with a sudden intensity,
as if in her burning grief she plunged into the grateful cooling waters of pity and
sympathy.
</p>
<p>“Oh, you darling! you angel!” she cried. “Forgive me, I—I did not mean to grieve you,
but—but—oh, yes, indeed, I will gladly stay, you are so good. May I stay?”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>That afternoon old Madame van Raat and Madame Verstraeten came to see Eline, and endeavoured
to persuade her to return to the Nassauplein. Eline, however, refused to receive them.
Even Betsy allowed Jeanne to persuade her to call on Eline, and ask her pardon. Jeanne
thought it was Betsy’s duty to try and make her peace with her sick sister, and it
might have a favourable effect on her. But Betsy Eline would not see either. And in
the adjoining room Betsy, with her mother-in-law and her aunt, heard, as Henk had
heard that morning in silence and anxiety, how Eline declared to Jeanne that she would
not—would not see any one. Only <span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>Jeanne and no one else would she see about her! Before long Eline’s quarrel with the
Van Raats and her flight to the Ferelyns became the general topic of conversation.
Of the details of the dispute they did not know much; only, of this they were certain,
that in that stormy night Eline had been seen sitting in a carriage with a night-watchman
and a young man, and to say the least of it they thought it passing strange! But then
Eline had always been rather eccentric. In the winter she had been in the habit of
taking early morning walks alone in the wood—what respectable young girl would think
of doing such a thing as that? Now—that affair with Erlevoort too, <i>that</i> was a bit mysterious; and now there was that romance with a young man and a night-watchman!
It was a pity certainly, for she was really such a nice girl, so pretty and graceful;
but had they not always been a strange family, those Veres?
</p>
<p>Betsy was mad with spite at this talk, and she scarcely ventured to show herself anywhere,
seeking her refuge only at the Verstraetens’ and with Emilie de Woude.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ch25" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#ch25.toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A month had elapsed, a month which Eline spent with the Ferelyns, as Jeanne would
not allow her to go until she had quite recovered. Reyer had told them that Eline
had caught a severe cold which, with the least neglect, might prove fatal. Jeanne
in the meantime tended her with gentle care; Frans’s little office she had had fitted
up specially for her, and when Eline protested and began again to talk about an hotel,
Frans himself declared that he thought he ought not to work so hard, a little rest
was necessary for him. Eline, therefore, embraced Jeanne with a passionate gratitude
and stayed on, while her violent fits of coughing filled the little house as with
a painful echo.
</p>
<p>Her cough was a little better now; she felt not quite as much pain on her chest. But
she had grown very thin, her eyes were hollow and dull, and her face was wan and sallow.
She sat in a <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>big chair close to the little stove, and she gazed out of the window and amused herself
a little watching the tradesmen—the butcher, the greengrocer, the milkman—as they
called from house to house; she amused herself watching the servants who opened the
door—a stout, red-faced one here, a tall thin one there, then again the mistress herself,
in a black apron and a dirty little lace cap.
</p>
<p>Then she rose and looked in the little black-framed glass, simple as all around her
was. She expected some one, and she looked eagerly at her face; it was such a long
time since she had seen him; what sort of impression would she make on him, with that
sallow face and those sunken eyes?
</p>
<p>For Betsy had written a long letter to her uncle, Daniel Vere, who during Eline’s
minority had been her guardian, and who was only lately married and living in Brussels.
When old Aunt Vere died he was still single, so that it was out of the question for
Eline to make her home with him. He came but seldom to the Hague, and when he received
Betsy’s letter, in which Eline’s flight was described to him, it seemed to him that
he was being drawn into matters that did not concern him. He replied to it, however,
and at the same time wrote to Eline, asking her for an interview. His letter surprised
her, and agreeably so, and she thought that through him she could see a relief from
her present position, which, when she should have quite recovered, would certainly
be no longer bearable to her. She therefore replied to him in the most amiable terms,
and promised to do as he required her on the one condition only, that he did not ask
her to make her peace with her sister and again to make her home with the Van Raats;
that she should on any account have to refuse, as the past had already taught her
that Betsy and she could not get on together; with whom the fault was it was not for
her to say.
</p>
<p>Vere then telegraphed what day and hour he would be coming to see Eline. And now she
awaited him, and examined her emaciated features, and feared, as she saw herself so
worn and emaciated, that she would not be able to shed around her that all-powerful
charm with which she attracted every man towards her. She drew down the curtain a
little, so that the light should not fall with such a glare on her sallow complexion.
In the afternoon he came.
</p>
<p>He was tall and slender, with the somewhat languid movements <span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>peculiar to all the Veres except Betsy, who was more like her mother. On Eline, who
had not seen him for two years, he made a very favourable impression. He had the appearance
of a thorough man of the world, and she felt a little ashamed to receive him in this
little room and amid these humble surroundings. She rose slowly and languidly from
her seat, and walked towards him, while Jeanne shut the door and retired.
</p>
<p>“How do you do, uncle?” said Eline softly. “I am very glad to see you, very glad.”
</p>
<p>She held out her hand to him, and pointed to a chair. He sat down, looked at her rather
searchingly, smiled a little sad smile, and shook his head.
</p>
<p>“For shame, Eline,” he began slowly. “What sorrow you have caused me. Do you know
I’m very dissatisfied with you, little girl?”
</p>
<p>“I suppose Betsy has written all sorts of things about me?” she asked with assumed
indifference, but with real curiosity.
</p>
<p>“What Betsy has written me came upon me like a thunderbolt. I had no idea that you
were so out of sympathy with your sister. I thought you were very happy at the Van
Raats’. Last spring you wrote me such an enthusiastic letter about your engagement,
and now Betsy tells me that you have released Van Erlevoort from his word. But still
I had no idea whatever that such scenes had taken place. Eline, Eline, how can you
allow yourself to be carried away like this by your feelings, without the slightest
attempt at self-control?”
</p>
<p>He searched a little for his words, proceeding cautiously, with much misgiving whether
she would allow him to persuade her to another course. The news of her flight had
given him the idea that she was a very violent, impetuous creature. Now her gentle
reticence seemed to him very suspicious, and he feared every moment that she would
jump up and do something desperate. But she replied very quietly—
</p>
<p>“Look here, uncle. I ran away from Henk and Betsy, it is true; but that is no reason
why you should imagine that I do nothing but silly things. I was beside myself with
passion because of Betsy’s aggravating manner. Now I’m sorry that I did not control
myself, that I did not simply turn my back on her, to leave her house the next day
in peace and quietness. But I think you will agree with me that there are moments
in life when—yes, when one is no longer master of oneself.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>“And you are determined, then, that you will not return?”
</p>
<p>“I thought I had told you as much in my letter,” she answered, a little piqued.
</p>
<p>“That is true; but I hoped—perhaps you would alter your mind.”
</p>
<p>“Never!” she said calmly and deliberately, and still with a certain hauteur.
</p>
<p>“Very well then; if that is the case we shall not return to it. I am sorry if that
is your decision, but I suppose you have considered everything?”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” she said, and gave a little cough.
</p>
<p>“Well, then I must propose something else; or rather—what do you think of doing when
you have got rid of that wretched cough?”
</p>
<p>Eline looked at him with some anxiety, and all her pride vanished.
</p>
<p>“I have been thinking about it myself. I really don’t know. Perhaps I shall go and
live by myself. I have a good many things of my own, and I can be economical. Then
perhaps too I can get some one to stay with me.”
</p>
<p>And in her fancy she already saw herself ensconced in a set of quaint little rooms
something like those she occupied now, and her eyes filled with tears.
</p>
<p>“That is a sensible idea, at all events. Here in the Hague do you think?”
</p>
<p>“Well, yes, I dare say; but I really am not certain. Maybe I shall go to a smaller
place.”
</p>
<p>“Well, anyhow that is an after consideration. The fact is, there is something I wanted
to propose to you myself.”
</p>
<p>He took her hand, and glanced at her with his lack-lustre eyes. And she thought that
perhaps he was about to ask her to come and stay with them in Brussels; if so, should
she accept?
</p>
<p>“I am going abroad with your aunt, Eline, for the winter. I cannot help laughing when
I speak about your ‘aunt,’ for, as you know, she is scarcely five years your senior.
We are first going to Paris, and then perhaps to Spain. And so now I wanted to suggest
that you should accompany us. You want a little change after what has happened; we
may perhaps stay abroad right through the winter. When you get tired of it you can
leave, and then there will be time enough to go and live by yourself. With my wife
I dare say you will get on very well, she is very good company, a real <i lang="fr">Française</i>. What do you think of this plan?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p>Eline looked at him confusedly with her tearful eyes. Yes, it was very true she needed
change, and she should travel about right through the winter! And at that thought
it was as if a flood of sunshine had suddenly lit up the sombre darkness of her soul.
No life without change Vincent had said.
</p>
<p>“I really do not know what to say, uncle,” she said with some emotion. “I am not very
cheerful just now, and I fear you won’t find me pleasant company.”
</p>
<p>“That is nothing at all, my girl; when you find yourself in different surroundings,
and see different faces, your ideas will change too. There is nothing so necessary
in this life as change; we cannot live without it!”
</p>
<p>She started, and looked at him with a smile. It was as if Vincent had spoken! And
she felt grateful, very grateful, for his kind offer, for his kindly voice. Yes, she
consented, consented with gratitude.
</p>
<p>“You see, you can come and stay with us in Brussels for a few days first, and then
we can go; we do a deal of travelling, and we do it economically, but without denying
ourselves any pleasure. You see, we understand the art, and as for you—you have money
enough, you are a good catch for anybody, aren’t you, eh?” he concluded smilingly.
</p>
<p>“I a good catch? My wealth is not very great, I can tell you, and I am no longer in
the market,” she said with a little sad smile. “You see, I am getting old gradually;
I’ve served my time.”
</p>
<p>He spoke to her as cheeringly as he could. Her trip would cure her of all those gloomy
ideas. After Jeanne, whom Eline had called into the room, had been told of the plan,
he left; he had still to pay a visit to the Nassauplein, to the Van Raats.
</p>
<p>Eline remained alone while Jeanne conducted him to the door. A multitude of thoughts
rushed through her brain, like showering rose-leaves, like sparks of sunshine, like
glittering bubbles of soap. She looked out of the window at the great clouds of dust
which the wind blew up from the paths and roadways. And she turned away shuddering
at the grave tints of autumn that met her gaze, when all at once her eye fell on Frans’s
diary, which was hanging on the wall, with the date 15th November distinctly visible.
</p>
<p>Great heavens! that was the very day which only a few months ago Otto and herself
had fixed upon as—their wedding day! Her gaze was as transfixed on those black figures.
A wild, a hopeless grief and remorse suddenly overwhelmed all her new bright <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>happiness, and savagely she flung herself into her big chair and sobbed as if she
would sob her very life out.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The news soon spread; the Eekhofs, the Hydrechts, and the Van Larens repeated it to
one another; Eline Vere was going abroad with her uncle, Daniel Vere, who lived in
Brussels and had only been married a year.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ch26" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#ch26.toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Her head languidly resting against the red velvet cushions, Eline was seated alone
in the ladies’ coupé. She listened mechanically to the rattling of the wheels along
the rail, and it seemed to her as if she heard a nervous tattoo in that monotonous
hard melody of steel and iron. Once or twice she took her handkerchief and wiped the
glass to have a glance outside, where the gray evening shades were falling, and an
opaque mist was rising over the meadows. In a few minutes she would be in the Hague,
in the Hague, where now she had not been for eighteen months, and after her continuous
wanderings the place seemed dear to her now, a place where yet she might find something
of a home.
</p>
<p>For eighteen months she had been travelling, and in all that time she had lived with
strangers without the smallest spot that she could call her own. The changeful life
she had led made the time pass rapidly; change, ceaseless change had been hers. New
cities, new scenes, new people, wherever she went, until she was tired, dead tired
of all this variety. Now she longed for rest and calmness, for a long dull period
of slumbering repose, free from dreams and free from sorrows.
</p>
<p>Something of a home! Should she indeed find that, with that sad, aged woman who loved
her, but who did not understand her as she was now—quiet, sadly quiet, and tired,
utterly tired of her young life? For henceforth she would be sad and quiet and tired
of it all, she would not again excite herself to an artificial glitter of gaiety,
as she had been forced to do among the strangers with whom she had sojourned.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span></p>
<p>She heard the shrill whistle of the engine, and the lights that glimmered through
the mist grew in number at every moment. She was approaching the Hague slowly. She
rose, arranged her hat and her veil, placed her book and her scent-bottle in her leather
satchel, and sat waiting, looking somewhat thin and worn, her face sallow and emaciated,
her eyes dull and sunk deep within their sockets. She sat waiting until the train
glided into the station and came to a stop.
</p>
<p>Her heart beat and the tears glistened on her lashes. Through the steam-covered glass,
in the dull glow of the gas-lights, she could see the busy turmoil of the station,
and she heard the loud voices of the guard calling out—
</p>
<p>“Hague, Hague!”
</p>
<p>The carriage-door was opened; she rose, her portmanteau, her rug and sunshades in
her hand. Amid the rushing to and fro of the travellers her eyes sought Paul; she
knew that he was coming to fetch her, and she gave a sudden start when she saw a familiar
burly form make his way through the crowd and approach her.
</p>
<p>“Henk!” she cried.
</p>
<p>He helped her out and she nearly fell into his arms, while Paul, who followed him,
relieved her of her luggage.
</p>
<p>“Elly—my child! Elly, dearest!” said Henk in a choking voice, and gently he kissed
her, while she lay her sobbing head on his shoulder. She scarcely heard Paul’s greeting,
and quite mechanically she held out her hand to him. A wild sob escaped her. But Henk
still spoke on, he took her arm and led her to the front of the station where his
carriage was waiting. She let him lead her, full of undefined thoughts, full of a
vague sadness, and she leant on his hand and stepped into the carriage.
</p>
<p>“We shall wait for Paul a moment,” said Henk, who took his place beside her.
</p>
<p>She did not answer, but lay back in the cushions and covered her head with her hand.
</p>
<p>“I did not expect to see you, Henk; it’s very kind of you, very kind indeed,” she
at last was able to say. He gently pressed her hand, and leaned his head out of the
window. Paul was approaching.
</p>
<p>“All the luggage is right,” he said, and sprang into the carriage. “Well, Elly dear,
I am glad to see you again.”
</p>
<p>The footman closed the door and the carriage rolled away. Paul said nothing more,
neither did Eline or Henk. By the light of <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>every gas-lamp they passed, Paul saw Eline lying back in the cushions motionless,
her hands covering her face, her bosom heaving with sobs, and they remained silent.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>It was past ten when the carriage drew up in front of the house in the Laan van Meerdervoort.
The footman rang the bell, the door was opened, they stepped out. In the hall stood
Madame van Raat, trembling with emotion, and Eline rushed towards her and flung her
arms round her neck.
</p>
<p>“Dear, dear little madam! dear little mother!” she sobbed, “you will have me stay
with you, won’t you?”
</p>
<p>The old lady wept like a child, and took Eline’s arm and led her into the dining-room;
the table was laid, and supper was waiting.
</p>
<p>“Oh, what a dear old darling you are!” cried Eline. “I am so glad, so glad that I
may come and stay with you.” She clasped the weeping old lady in her arms, and Madame
van Raat made her sit down on the sofa, and sat down beside her with her arm round
her waist. What a time it was since she had seen Eline, and how was she looking now?
All right? “Oh yes, yes, I am quite well,” cried Eline, and kissed her again and again.
</p>
<p>But the old lady undid Eline’s veil, and helped her to remove her hat and her cloak.
And oh, very soon she saw—that emaciated frame, those hollow cheeks, those dull eyes.
</p>
<p>“My child,” she cried, unable to contain herself, “my child, oh, how changed you are,
how bad you look!”
</p>
<p>Eline embraced her passionately, and hid her glowing little head in the old lady’s
bosom.
</p>
<p>“Oh, you must not take any notice of that, I am a little tired of travelling—perhaps
I look a little pale, eh? Really you shall see, when I’ve been with you a little time
again, I shall look as fresh as a daisy.” She smiled at the old lady through her tears,
and kissed her repeatedly, now her cheeks, then her old shrivelled hand.
</p>
<p>Henk and Paul entered, and they too were touched by Eline’s altered appearance, but
although it alarmed them, they said nothing. The old lady could not keep her eyes
from Eline; she wiped her eyes, and asked Eline whether she would not like to wash
her hands.
</p>
<p>“No, never mind,” cried Eline; “I feel a little dusty, but it does not matter. Oh,
Henk, my dear old Henk.”
</p>
<p>She motioned Henk towards her, made him sit down by her side, and clasped his big
head in her little hands.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Aren’t you—aren’t you angry with me any more, Henk?” she murmured close to his ear.
</p>
<p>He bit his lips with emotion. “I never was—angry with you,” he stammered with a choking
voice. She kissed him, then released her hold of him, gave a sigh of relief, and cast
a long glance around her. Yes, she had found something of a home.
</p>
<p>They sat down at table, but Eline had no appetite; she just touched her soup, but
eat she could not at all. But she asked Paul to fill and refill her glass, for she
was thirsty. The wine and her emotion brought a blush to her sallow cheeks, and when
the old lady asked her why Uncle Daniel had not brought her home, she laughed, a loud
and nervous laugh. Oh, she could very well journey from Brussels to the Hague by herself;
uncle wanted to take her, but she refused his escort, she was so used to travelling
now. Nothing was easier than travelling, she need only pack her trunks, ask a few
questions here and there, and take her seat in the carriage. Why, it was nothing.
</p>
<p>Quickly and nervously she spoke on, her glass, which she repeatedly put to her lips,
clasped in her hands. She spoke about her life in Paris, in Bordeaux, and in Spain.
Ah! Spain, there she lived again. Spain! the land of romance, the land of ancient
Moorish chivalry and elegance. As for Granada and the Alhambra it was grand, magnificent;
to the bull-fights she would never go, although Elise had laughed at her, but she
could not stand it, such a dirty thing to see those dead, mangled, bleeding beasts.
</p>
<p>Paul laughed, and she laughed too, and pitied the poor bulls, and still she spoke
on; the old lady continually urged her to eat something, but she refused.
</p>
<p>“Really not, little madam, really not, thank you. I can only drink a little, I’m so
thirsty. May I have another glass?”
</p>
<p>“Can you take so much wine, child?”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes, it makes me sleep beautifully. If I don’t take wine I lie awake all night,
and that is so wretched. Cordova is a beautiful city too, there is such a grand mosque
there.”
</p>
<p>And she allowed herself to be driven forward along the nervous stream of her travelling
impressions. Why did not Paul travel more than he did? if she were a young man and
had money, she would always travel, always. Long journeys would she make, from New
York to San Francisco, and then by sea to Japan, all over the world. How beautiful!
It was splendid, splendid in a railway <span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>carriage, she could pass her life in a train! The old lady shook her head, gently
smiling at her enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>“But nicer still than all it is to come and live with you here, my dear little madam,
my little dot,” she cried; and with sudden impetuosity she embraced the gray-haired
old lady.
</p>
<p>After supper Madame van Raat suggested that Eline should go and take a little rest
in her room. Eline agreed, but little madam was to stay with her—would she? Paul had
an appointment with some friends, and took his leave, and Henk too rose.
</p>
<p>“May Betsy come and see you to-morrow?” he whispered a little anxiously. She smiled
and looked at him questioningly, pressing his hand.
</p>
<p>“Certainly,” she replied; “kiss her for me, will you? And how is Ben, has he grown
much?”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes, he is an immense boy. You shall see him to-morrow. Well, good-bye, Elly,
good-night.”
</p>
<p>“Good-bye, Henk, till to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>Henk left, and Madame took Eline up-stairs to her room.
</p>
<p>“For the present I cannot give you a sitting-room, Elly,” she said on the staircase,
“at least so long as Paul is with me.”
</p>
<p>“Where does he think of going to then?”
</p>
<p>“He wants to live by himself; that is best too for a young man, is it not? But your
bedroom is a very large one, you know that room next to mine?”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes, I remember, ’tis a splendid room.”
</p>
<p>In her room the gas was lit, and the French windows were open, so that the cool evening
air blew inside. Eline coughed a little when she entered.
</p>
<p>“’Tis rather cool, I shall close the window,” said the old lady.
</p>
<p>Eline looked about her in astonishment, and her eyes grew moist.
</p>
<p>“But, little madam, little madam, what have you done?” she exclaimed with emotion.
</p>
<p>For wherever her eye went she saw some souvenir of her rooms on the Nassauplein. There
was her Psyche yonder, her toilet dishes; in this corner her writing-desk, her letter-rack;
there hung her Venetian mirror; round about her in tasteful profusion her statuettes
were arranged; while almost the only thing that was new in the room was the big bedstead,
on which the dark blue curtains were suspended like a baldaquin from the wall.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Does it suit you?” asked Madame van Raat. “I thought you would like your own things
best; but, child, what is the matter now, what are you crying about?”
</p>
<p>She allowed Eline’s arms to encircle her, and Eline wept on her shoulder and kissed
her again and again. The old lady made her sit down on the couch, and sat down beside
her, and Eline still leaned against her as a weeping child leans against her mother.
</p>
<p>“Oh, now, now at last I begin to feel the luxury of rest,” she said wearily, “for
I am so tired, so tired.”
</p>
<p>“Shall I leave you alone then, if you want to sleep?”
</p>
<p>“No, no, stay, do stay here; it is not the five hours in the train that has made me
tired. I am tired, tired of everything, and that sleep will not cure; but still now
I feel that I am resting, not because I am sitting down, but because it is on you
that I am leaning, and because I know that you care for me. You see I needed it so
much—in all this travelling, among all those strange people—I needed somebody upon
whom I could lean, somebody who would give me a little, a very little love and affection,
but it was all so cold, so deadly cold around me, with all the kindliness and courtesy.
Uncle Daniel too is just like all the rest, very friendly, very kind, very polite,
but so cold. With Elise I was always having some joke or another, all about her is
light and airy as foam, but she too is cold, cold and cynical, and with all those
strangers I was always obliged to be on my friendliest behaviour, and always smiling,
for who would have cared to be bothered with a guest who was not jolly? And where
was I to go to, if I did not lodge somewhere or was on my journey?”
</p>
<p>“But, child, you could always have come to me, and I should have written to you before
this if I had thought you were so unhappy, but I always imagined that you were very
happy indeed.”
</p>
<p>“Happy!” groaned Eline, “yes, happy as a horse that cannot go further, and is driven
along by blows and kicks;” and she laughed, a laugh of bitter sadness.
</p>
<p>Her laugh cut into Madame van Raat’s soul like a knife. The tears sparkled in her
dulled eyes and she could not speak, she could only clasp Eline closer to her breast.
</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right, hold me close to you,” murmured Eline softly. “This is rest, rest
indeed—my dear, dear old pet.”
</p>
<p>Thus they remained seated for a long time, and neither of them spoke another word
until the old lady insisted that Eline should <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>try and sleep. She would stay close to her, Eline need but open a door, and she would
be with her.
</p>
<p>“If you want anything say so, or you will ring, won’t you, child? Do exactly as if
you were at home. Ask for whatever you want.”
</p>
<p>Eline promised she would, and the old lady left her. But Eline’s heart was still too
full for her to retire to bed at once. She glanced around her, and in every nook,
in every corner, she recognized her own vases, her plates, and her photos. Then her
glance fell upon a Japanese box on the table. Her little bunch of keys was lying beside
it, she took it up, found the right key, and opened the box. In it there were a number
of letters discoloured with age—letters from old schoolmates, letters from Aunt Vere,
written at a time when she was at boarding-school. The former she would tear up, for
she felt no longer an attachment for the gushing professions of girls whom she never
saw, and whom she had forgotten as they had forgotten her. A letter or two she found
also from her father—her father who had been so dear to her—and she kissed the paper
with veneration as though it had been sacred. But all at once, while she was arranging
her papers, there fell from those discoloured pages a small piece of cardboard. She
stooped, picked it up from the floor—and she turned white as a sheet, while her eyes
stared wildly in front of her.
</p>
<p>“Oh!” she groaned, as if an old wound had suddenly been opened. “Oh, oh heavens!”
</p>
<p>It was a small portrait of Otto’s. How did it come there, among all those old letters?
Ah, yes, she remembered, it was the proof of a photograph which once he had had taken
for her. The portrait itself, which during her engagement she had constantly carried
about her, she had returned him, together with his other presents, with the Bucchi
fan. This little proof had got lost among her letters, and she had never given it
another thought.
</p>
<p>“Oh!” she groaned again. “Oh!”
</p>
<p>She wept, she sobbed, she pressed the portrait to her lips. That little proof was
now her greatest treasure, and for ever—yes, for ever—she would carry it about her,
it was the only thing that was left to her out of her great happiness, that happiness
that had slipped from between her fingers like a precious bird. And this was the only
little feather it had left behind.
</p>
<p>“Otto—Otto,” she murmured. And her tears and kisses covered the little piece of cardboard.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span></p>
<p>In her own room Madame van Raat still sat meditating. Sadly, her eyes full of tears,
she shook her head. How was it possible, while she had been so long happy with her
husband, that her dear little Elly had known so little of real pleasure? and in her
piety—the piety and childlike faith of a simple heart, a heart full of gratitude for
that which once had been granted it—she folded her shrivelled hands and prayed, prayed
for her dear little Elly, prayed that she might be happy.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Next morning, at the breakfast-table, a sudden impulse moved Eline.
</p>
<p>“Little madam,” she began in soft, trembling tones, and she laid her hands on that
of the old lady. “Little madam, I wanted to ask you something. Do you see anything
of Erlevoort now?”
</p>
<p>The old lady looked at her as though she would fain have guessed Eline’s thoughts,
but she could not gather anything from those feverish eyes, from those nervously-moving
fingers.
</p>
<p>“What makes you ask that, Elly?”
</p>
<p>It was the first time that she had spoken to Eline about Otto since the breaking of
her engagement.
</p>
<p>“Oh, I should so like to know if it affected him much, and if he’s happy now. Do you
never meet him?”
</p>
<p>“I have met him once or twice at my brother-in-law’s on the Princessegracht.”
</p>
<p>“How does he look?”
</p>
<p>“He is not much changed, he may have aged a little perhaps, but it is not very noticeable.
He is certainly a little quiet and rather gloomy, but then he was never very boisterous,
was he?”
</p>
<p>“No,” murmured Eline, brimful of past memories.
</p>
<p>“He is not in the Hague now; he is at the Horze, I believe.”
</p>
<p>“Have I driven him away, I wonder?” thought Eline, and with an effort to make it appear
as though the interest she took in him was for his own sake, not for hers, she softly
said, “Then I suppose he has got over it; there is nothing I should like better than
to know him to be happy, he deserves it. He is a very good fellow.”
</p>
<p>The old lady said nothing, and Eline could with difficulty keep herself from crying.
Oh, was it not terrible that even before her dear old little pet she was obliged to
do violence to herself and be a hypocrite? Oh, what a hollow sham it all was! She,
she had <span class="pageNum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>always shammed, to her own self as well as to others, and she still shammed now. So
inured had she grown to her shamming and hypocrisy, that now she could not do otherwise.
</p>
<p>“And now there is something that I want to show you, which I hope you will like,”
said the old lady, who guessed something of Eline’s sadness; “follow me.” She led
her down-stairs, and opened the door of the drawing-room.
</p>
<p>“You know I used to have such an old cripple of a piano, because, you see, it was
only for Paul, who jingled a little on it to study his singing, but now just look
here.”
</p>
<p>They walked inside, and in the place of the old cripple they found a brand-new Bechstein;
her music-books in their red and gilt bindings lay on the top.
</p>
<p>“It will suit your voice splendidly, the tone is so clear.”
</p>
<p>Eline’s lips trembled and twitched nervously.
</p>
<p>“But, madam,” she stammered, “why did you do this—oh why, why did you do it? I—I don’t
sing any more.”
</p>
<p>“Why, why not?” asked the old lady, quite alarmed.
</p>
<p>Eline with a sigh threw herself in a chair.
</p>
<p>“I may not sing any more,” she exclaimed almost bitterly, for the new piano most cruelly
awoke the memory of her splendid voice of former days. “The doctors whom I consulted
in Paris have forbidden me; you see I have been coughing all the winter, and it is
only lately that my cough has been less. During the last two winters I have coughed
continually, and had such a pain here on my chest. In the summer-time I am quite well.”
</p>
<p>“But, child,” said the old lady anxiously, “didn’t you take good care of yourself
then, while you were abroad?”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes, the Des Luynes recommended me to some specialists in Paris, and they sounded
and tapped me and knocked me about until I was tired of it; besides that, I was constantly
under treatment of two regular doctors, but in the end I had enough of it. They did
not cure me, while they told me I should always have to reside in a warm climate.
But I could not remain vegetating all by myself in Algiers, or Heaven knows where,
and Uncle Daniel had to return to Brussels; so you see,” she concluded with a little
nervous laugh, “I am a hopeless wreck in every way.”
</p>
<p>The old lady pressed Eline’s head to her bosom, with the tears glistening in her eyes.
</p>
<p>“’Tis a pity, because of the nice piano,” said Eline, releasing <span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>herself from the old lady’s embrace and seating herself nervously at the piano. “What
a full clear tone, how rich and beautiful!”
</p>
<p>Her fingers glided quickly along the notes, the tones seemed to sob with grief at
that voice that was lost. The old lady looked on sadly, she had nursed herself in
the belief and hope that Eline would sing with Paul; that Paul, attracted and charmed
by the music, would stay much at home in the evening; that a melodious sweet sociability
would once more fill her lonely, silent rooms; but all she heard was the loud sob-like
notes as they came from under Eline’s fingers, the weeping dew of a chromatic bravura,
and the great running tears of painful staccatos.
</p>
<p>“Yes, I shall practise my piano playing. I never was a great pianist, but I shall
do what I can; you shall hear some music, dearie. What a tone, what a beautiful clear
tone!”
</p>
<p>And the clear, liquid notes followed one another as in a flowing torrent of grief.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>In honour of Eline, Paul took care to be home for coffee. In the afternoon Madame
Verstraeten came with Marie, and they were followed by Emilie de Woude. Eline received
them cordially, and showed herself pleased to see them. A strange feeling came over
Marie now that she heard and saw Eline once more; something of a fear it was, a misgiving,
whether Eline would also discover any change in her; but Eline did not seem to notice
anything, and talked on; she talked about her travels, about the cities she had visited,
about the people she had seen, talked on continuously with nervous rapidity, the thoughts
rushing closely one after another. She could not help it, it was the nervous state
in which she existed just now, a nervousness that overmastered her wherever she might
be, and ever kept her fingers in motion either crumpling up her handkerchief, plucking
at the fringe of the tablecloth, or swaying the tassels of her fauteuil backwards
and forwards. Her elegant languor, her graceful calm of former days was completely
gone.
</p>
<p>About four o’clock the drawing-room door was opened, and Betsy entered, leading Ben
by her hand. Eline rose and hurried towards her to hide her confusion under a show
of cordiality. She embraced her sister impetuously, and fortunately Betsy found some
appropriate words to say. Then Eline overwhelmed Ben with her kisses. He was a big
boy for his five years, but in his eyes there was that undefinable, sleepy expression
common to a <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>backward child. Still a happy memory seemed to steal over him, for his little lips
opened into a glad smile, and round Eline’s neck he flung his little chubby arms and
kissed her. After that neither of the sisters seemed to desire any very confidential
conversation, and Betsy left, together with the Verstraetens and Emilie, and Eline
did not press her to stay. Both of them felt that no closer tie than one of mere conventionality
bound them together. During the last eighteen months they had not seen each other,
and now that they did meet it seemed to them as though they were strangers, who made
a show of politeness and cordiality, saying all kinds of nice things, while a chill
indifference filled their hearts.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some weeks had passed by, and Madame van Raat was beginning to feel very uneasy about
Eline’s health. She wrote to Dr. Reyer, and he had visited Eline. Madame van Raat,
who was present at his visit, did not form a very great opinion of the ability of
the dapper little doctor, who talked about nothing but Paris and Spain, and seemed
only to have come to have a little chat. When two days later Reyer repeated his visit,
she received him somewhat coldly. She left the doctor and patient alone together for
a moment. Reyer rose somewhat in her favour when, after he had gone, Eline told her
how carefully Reyer had examined her. Then, after all, he did have an intelligent
idea of Eline’s condition, thought the old lady; and under his graceful elegance she
discovered Reyer’s firmness of will and strength of character, and with it the belief
in his skill too grew fixed in her mind. At his third visit, after he had left Eline,
she took him aside. He told her frankly that he would not mislead her, that he would
tell her the whole truth. Eline had the germs of pulmonary consumption, the consequence
of a severe cold which had been neglected. He would exert his skill to the utmost
in his endeavours to destroy that germ, but beyond all that he had discovered something
in Eline, something which he might <span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>call the fatal taint of her family. Eline’s father had suffered from it, so did Vincent.
It was a soul-disturbing unrest of the nerves, which were like the tangled chords
of a broken instrument. He would not presume to more skill than he really possessed;
it was not in his power to renew those chords, or to tune them so that they should
once more produce an harmonious tone. The delicate fibres of a flower, which a too
rough handling had bruised, it was not for him to infuse with fresh sap and renewed
vigour. That was a task which Madame understood better than he. She could tend and
nurture that flower, she could handle Eline so delicately, with such gentleness, that,
chord for chord, she might yet call back into her prematurely-wasted frame the whilom
vigour of her youth. Calmness, loving care, these were the remedies of which Eline
stood in need; then with the approach of winter, a milder clime than that of Holland.
</p>
<p>The tears came into Madame van Raat’s eyes as she listened to him; when he left she
pressed his hand cordially, full of grateful sympathy, but the task which he had given
her weighed heavily on her shoulders. She feared that Reyer had overrated the power
of her affection for the poor child; she inwardly suspected that a love other than
hers was necessary to draw forth sweet melody from that soul which was now so sadly
out of tune.
</p>
<p>At his next visit Dr. Reyer insisted that Eline should try and find some occupation
that would bring some life into that languid melancholy to which she had given herself
up from morning till night. Eline found an excuse for her idleness in the warm summer
weather; but now that the leaves were falling, now that the cool winds of early autumn
began to blow refreshingly in her face, it seemed to her that she breathed anew, and
she felt much more cheerful, and declared her determination to seek some occupation.
Madame van Raat continued to look at her with great anxiety, for with Eline’s renewed
vivacity her cough had also returned—a dull, hacking cough, which sounded as though
it would choke her. In the meantime she now dressed herself with a little more care
and taste than she had done during the past summer, and she practised industriously
on her new Bechstein; but music alone did not satisfy her, she needed another occupation,
and that she now sought elsewhere. Although she somewhat neglected her former acquaintances,
she still met them occasionally in Betsy’s drawing-room. While there one evening,
out of sheer <i>ennui</i> she <span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>arranged with an old lady, a Miss Eekhof, an aunt of Ange and Léonie, to go with her
on the following Sunday to the French Church. Eline went; a new preacher with great
black dreamy eyes and white aristocratic hands preached that day. She returned home
in ecstasy, and told Madame van Raat excitedly about the eloquent sermon to which
she had listened. She inwardly regretted that a Protestant Church was so cold, so
empty, so bare, that the singing was so bad; gladly she would have been a Catholic;
on an Ave Maria, or on a Gloria in Excelsis, her soul would have risen on high as
on the wings of melody; at the holy transfiguration, in the mystic glamour of the
altar, she would have trembled with glorious fervour, while the incense would have
imbued her very being with a flavour of theatrical piety. But she was not a Catholic,
and she consoled herself with her French Church; she now went there frequently with
Miss Eekhof, until it became a regular habit with her, and she occupied a fixed seat.
The acquaintances she met there she greeted with a serious little face, with soft
dreamy eyes and a melancholy droop about her little mouth, and every one began to
wonder at Eline’s new piety. Miss Eekhof was on the committee of several charities,
and it needed but little persuasion on her part to induce Eline to enrol herself as
a member of some of them, and many a time Miss Eekhof persuaded her to accompany her
on her visits to the poor.
</p>
<p>For a month or so she found a pleasure in this new piety, then the monotony of the
preacher’s unctuous words began to pall on her, and she could tell beforehand how
he would lift up his eyes at the singing, or what movement he would make with his
white hand when he pronounced the benediction. The singing quite unnerved her, hearing
it rising as she did from so many hoarse, uncultivated throats. The plain white walls,
the simply-constructed pulpit, and the wooden pews began more and more to irritate
her; she began to suspect that all these people who had come there to be edified were
really a set of hypocrites. The pious fervour of the preacher was a sham; the dignified
bearing of the elders was a sham. Miss Eekhof by her side, she too was shamming; and
she herself, with her soft melting eyes and her serious face, what was she but a sham!
</p>
<p>Through Miss Eekhof she heard of many a tiff, many a petty dispute among the lady
directors of the different societies, and of their good intentions she now too began
to doubt. Oh, she hated <span class="pageNum" id="pb263">[<a href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>that philanthropy, which was a cloak for so much jealousy and envy, and she could
no longer believe in the sincerity of those ladies, not even of those who had moved
her to sympathy; every one of them shammed and had some motives of her own, every
one was an egoist and thought only of herself, under the cloak of working for others.
</p>
<p>And after that first month she felt thoroughly disgusted with the poor people whom
she had visited with the old lady. The stuffy closeness of their dirty little rooms,
their wretchedness and misery, seemed to choke her very breath. Indeed, she would
have been suffocated had she but been forced for one single day to breathe such an
atmosphere, and as she mistrusted the lady managers, so she mistrusted the poor. Stories
of wealthy beggars rose to her mind; she had read of beggars living in London who
were as rich as bankers, and who spent their evenings in feasting and pleasure; and
although she remained a member of the different societies, and often enough gave Miss
Eekhof some money for an ailing widow or a blind old organ-grinder, she no longer
went to church, nor to these dirty people.
</p>
<p>Winter approached, and on account of her cough Eline remained at home a good deal
with Madame van Raat; in dull listlessness the days dragged by, one after another
without change, without a break in the monotony; for the hundredth time Eline asked
herself to what end she lived, why indeed should she live if she could not be happy.
After this disappointment in her own philanthropy and piety she would trust no one;
she looked around her, and she did not believe that Georges and Lili cared for each
other now that they were married, or that they were happy; no doubt they were deceived
in each other, and now they shammed so as to hide it. She did not believe that Betsy
was happy although she was rich, for how could it be possible that she cared for Henk,
and did not long for a more passionate love? And now she did not believe either that
Otto had ever loved her; how could he, seeing that his character was so entirely different
from hers? At one moment even her suspicion grew so intense and so all-absorbing that
she no longer believed in Madame van Raat’s unselfish affection for her. Madame van
Raat had hoped to find in her an agreeable companion, and now no doubt she was disappointed.
Yes, Madame van Raat shammed as all the others shammed. At one time such bitter feelings
as these would have <span class="pageNum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>driven Eline to despair, but now so much bitterness had already entered her soul,
that even those feelings could no longer irritate her; she remained quite indifferent
under them. What did it matter to her that life was one great lie? it was so, and
could not be helped, she could not alter it. She must play her part, and lie like
all the rest of them.
</p>
<p>At least, when she could not do otherwise, when they excited her to emotion, to “life”;
for as long as they did not, she would lie down, lie down in her blank indifference
as in a deadening rest. Thus she thought, and forced her youth to stoop under the
yoke of that apathy. To it she gave herself up completely, she even lost her charm
of manner. Among her acquaintances she no longer excited any pity, and gradually she
grew quite rude and disdainful; she got into the habit of staying in bed the greater
part of the morning, and although Madame van Raat disapproved of it, she nevertheless
had Eline’s breakfast taken to her, because otherwise she would not breakfast at all.
</p>
<p>Eline felt well enough that she could not go on leading this kind of life; something
she could not have described continually irritated her in Madame van Raat and in her
house. Involuntarily Eline allowed her peevish fits to overmaster her, so that she
addressed the old lady in words of passionate irritation. Then the old lady would
merely look at her with a sad expression, and Eline felt at once how wrong she was.
Sometimes she was too proud to acknowledge it, and then she had a sulking fit which
perhaps lasted a day or two, and during which she scarcely spoke a word. At other
times, again, she was so brimming over with remorse that she would sobbingly throw
herself upon her knees, lay her head in the old lady’s lap, and beg for her pardon.
No, little madam should not take notice of her wretched fits of temper. She could
not make them out herself, and she could not control them. Oh, they were like so many
demons, who dragged her away against her will wherever they would have her. The old
lady wept as well, kissed her, and the next day the same demons dragged Eline along
with them. No, it would not do, thought Eline. She wrote a long letter to her Uncle
Daniel and Elise. She wrote that, loving and affectionate as Madame van Raat was,
she felt very unhappy, and that she would die with melancholy did she stay there—she
longed for other surroundings.
</p>
<p>Uncle Daniel came to the Hague, and asked Eline in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>presence of the old lady if she had quite forgotten the family in Brussels, and if
she would not like to pay them a visit.
</p>
<p>Eline did not know what to decide, but the old lady herself urged Eline not to refuse
her uncle’s invitation, and go to Brussels. When Daniel Vere had left, Madame van
Raat, as though crushed under a heavy disappointment, remained seated motionless on
her chair; and her gray head, with its dull, staring eyes, drooped with even more
than its wonted languor upon her chest. In two days Eline would leave her; there was
the end then of all her expectations. She had hoped, old and weak as she was, to be
of some use to this young life, and to infuse a fresh vigour into this dulled youth,
and—and she guessed it—Eline grew more and more listless; Eline longed for change.
How could she, old woman that she was, have had such presumption?
</p>
<p>Eline did not fail to notice this silent grief, and a great despair overmastered her,
a despair at her own egoism. She had not given a thought to the old lady when she
wrote to Uncle Daniel, it was only of herself that she had thought; and now she caused
the old lady pain by her departure, while she felt convinced that she, after her change
of residence, would remain the same as she, faded in body and soul, had now been for
the last two years, and, amid nervous sobbing, fell back on the sofa, to rise again
immediately in a wild, indefinite terror. Her eyes glittered wildly, and her fingers
were constantly moving, touching a vase here, tangling the fringe of the curtains,
or scratching fantastic figures on the bevapoured window-panes. It seemed to her suddenly
as if she had just awakened from a dream, and the memory of what had passed before
completely forsook her.
</p>
<p>“I suppose you did not understand me?” she asked doubtfully of the old lady, whose
sad glance had constantly followed her.
</p>
<p>“I—I think—I did!” stammered she, inwardly shocked at the picture of lost happiness
which Eline presented.
</p>
<p>Eline looked at her with a vacant stare; for a moment she felt a great regret at her
confession, of which she scarcely longer remembered the words. But the sympathy beamed
from the old lady’s eyes reassured her.
</p>
<p>“You did understand me? You understand why it is that I can no longer be happy?” she
asked in a voice of bitter sadness, as once more she sank down on her footstool.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>The old lady did not answer, but, with her eyes full of tears, she threw her arms
round Eline’s neck and kissed her. Both remained thus for a moment in silence.
</p>
<p>“And can you now forgive me for leaving you?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, why do you not stay with me?”
</p>
<p>“I’m a trouble and a sorrow to you. I do not give you the slightest pleasure. I can
do nothing for you, and you can do nothing for me.”
</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, it was too true. The old lady could do nothing for her—no one could.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>They found nothing more to say to each other. Both understood well enough that they
could render each other no help in bearing the burdens of life, that neither could
be of any comfort to the other. But now the old lady began to doubt, too, whether
even Uncle Daniel or Elise could be of any comfort to Eline. And though they said
not another word, still the old lady sat there with Eline clasped close to her bosom.
</p>
<p>It grew dark, and a cheerless chill began to fill the rooms. Sombre shadows were descending
in every corner behind the draperies and along the walls. The old lady shivered with
the chill atmosphere, but she did not rise to ring the bell for the servant to look
after the dying fire, for Eline had fallen asleep with her head resting on her shoulder.
Were it not for Eline’s heavy breathing, Madame van Raat would have thought that death
had overtaken her. The waxen pallor of those emaciated features was like unto the
dew of death.
</p>
<p>Eline slept on, and it grew chiller and chiller. The old lady glanced at the stove;
not a spark of fire was to be seen. Slowly she removed the woollen pelerine from her
shoulders, and gently spread it over Eline’s sleeping form.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span></p>

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A month had passed, during which Eline had been living a life of semi-lethargy, of
languid indifference, at the house of her uncle in the Avenue Louise at Brussels.
Her cough was still very troublesome, but she felt herself comparatively at ease in
her surroundings. Elise, though she chattered somewhat, seemed rather to like her;
and Uncle Daniel, though he was somewhat cold in his studied politeness, was very
amiable also. Sometimes, indeed, a suspicion rose to her mind that they shammed as
every one in the Hague had shammed, but she would not stop to analyze this doubt;
she was satisfied to allow her brain to be gradually enveloped by the lethargic indifference
which was more and more becoming a part of her very being.
</p>
<p>Quite unexpectedly one day Uncle Daniel received a letter from Vincent Vere from New
York. They were not in the habit of corresponding, and uncle was somewhat surprised.
Eline, whose correspondence with her cousin had not been of very long duration, now
that his name sounded so unexpectedly in her ears felt her interest in him revive;
she was very anxious to know what the contents of his letter might be. Perhaps he
asked for money.
</p>
<p>But in this Eline was mistaken. Vincent asked for no money, nor even for a recommendation
<span class="corr" id="xd31e4656" title="Source: of">or</span> any help whatever. He simply wrote that he intended to take a trip to Europe with
his friend Lawrence St. Clare, and they would visit Brussels. This letter roused Eline
somewhat from her mental lethargy. She called to mind how Vincent, languid and weak,
had reclined on her sofa in his Turkish dressing-gown, and how she had tended him.
With this memory the thought of Otto became mingled, and with nervous agitation her
fingers played around the black enamelled locket of her chain. Had she not fancied
that Vincent loved her and that she loved him? Were any of those feelings now still
remaining in her heart? No, those feelings were gone—vanished like birds that had
flown away. Uncle and Elise talked a little about Vincent, and then remained silent;
but Eline, though she said nothing, thought a great deal about him and his American
friend.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>After a week or two Uncle Daniel received a second letter from Vincent, this time
dated from Paris. In a few days the two young <span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>men arrived, and they remained to dinner. Uncle and Elise out of politeness asked
them to make their stay in the house, but St. Clare refused—they had already taken
their rooms at the Hôtel des Flandres.
</p>
<p>Vincent was not at all changed in his appearance and his movements, and Eline all
at once remarked, when both of them were standing beside each other, and she saw her
face reflected in the glass, how greatly she had aged. He in his elegant, gentlemanly
attire was the same as he had been two years ago. His face even, beside her own yellow,
emaciated features, seemed to her healthier than ever she had seen it before. She
in her black lace, a material which she now constantly wore, with her drooping shoulders
and her sombre, lack-lustre eyes, seemed a mere wreck of her former sparkling youth.
Lawrence St. Clare made a very agreeable impression both on Eline and on Elise. With
her ideas of a Yankee, Eline had rather fancied him somewhat boorish and rough—perhaps
chewing, swearing, and eternally drinking whisky—and she was very agreeably surprised
by his winning, easy manner. Tall, and of a powerful frame, with his full-grown beard,
which fell upon his bosom, a certain pride gleaming from his eyes, not the pride of
vanity, but one that denoted power and strength of will. Although formerly Eline had
only now and then heard Vincent drop a word about St. Clare, it seemed to her now
as though she had known him ever so long. His frank smile, his soft but penetrating
eyes, charmed her and aroused her from her lethargy, and it suddenly struck her, when
her glance went round the table, what a peaceful, calm, healthful truth beamed from
him, by the side of which the studied politeness of her uncle, the airy effervescence
of Elise, the misty melancholy of Vincent and of herself, seemed but vain, hollow
hypocrisy and unhealthy sham. After dinner they took coffee in the large salon, and
Eline felt herself contented in St. Clare’s company, and inwardly hoped that none
of her other acquaintances would come and disturb the harmony. Yet she had not much
conversation with St. Clare. Elise took him in tow altogether, asking him hundreds
of questions about New York, Philadelphia, and other places. He answered her in French,
and spoke slowly with a foreign accent, which charmed Eline. Vincent took both her
hands in his and looked at her attentively. He was grateful to her for what she had
one day done for him, and something like pity filled him now.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I am rather disappointed in you, Elly,” said he, as they sat down in the balcony.
“You must try and get a little stouter; do you hear?”
</p>
<p>She laughed a little, and the tip of her little shoe moved about nervously among the
soft white rugs.
</p>
<p>“It is nothing at all,” said she. “I have not felt at all so unwell lately. I have
been much worse than this, and I am very glad to see you once more, very glad indeed.
You know I always rather liked you.”
</p>
<p>She gave him her hand and he pressed it, and drew his fauteuil a little closer to
her.
</p>
<p>“And what do you think of Lawrence?” he asked; “do you like him?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, I believe he is a very good fellow, is he not?”
</p>
<p>“He is the only man whom I have ever known upon whom one can depend. There is no one
in the world in whom I have any confidence—no, no one—not even in you, nor in myself;
but him—him I trust. What funny French he speaks, eh?”
</p>
<p>“He speaks it very nicely,” answered Eline.
</p>
<p>“You have no idea what he would do for any one to whom he takes,” Vincent continued.
“If I told you what he has done for me, you would not believe me. It is not every
one whom I should like to tell what he has forced me to accept, and even when I tell
you about it I certainly feel a bit ashamed. You must know that in New York I was
very ill indeed, in fact, all but dying. At that time I had a situation in a house
of business with which he is financially connected. Well, he took me into his own
house and tended me almost with as much care as you did. I really do not understand
how I have deserved his friendship, and I do not know how I can repay. Still, I would
do anything for him. If now there is a grain of goodness in me at all, it is his influence
that has produced it. It was he who kept my place open for me while I was ill, but
a little while ago he decided to do a little travelling. He did not know much about
Europe, and he declared that my situation was really too hard for me. In a word, he
invited me to accompany him. I refused at first, because already I was under such
obligations to him, but he forced me, and at last I yielded. With the coming winter
he intends to go to St. Petersburg and Moscow, and next summer he will wander about
the south of Europe. You know I have always been fond of change, and have <span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>careered about a good deal myself, so no doubt I shall be of some service to him as
a guide, but I have never travelled in such a style as this before. Wherever we go
we have the pick of everything.”
</p>
<p>He paused, somewhat tired of his long whispering.
</p>
<p>“Has he so much sympathy for you?” said Eline softly. “How curious! I do not know
him, of course; but I should say that his character is entirely in contrast with yours.”
</p>
<p>“So it is. You are right. Perhaps it is for that very reason that he likes me; at
all events, he is always declaring that I am much better than others think me, and
than I even think myself.”
</p>
<p>“Perhaps he finds you interesting as Elise finds me,” said Eline, with an involuntary
sly little laugh. But now that she saw St. Clare approaching, she felt some self-reproach,
as though she had wronged him. How could she compare the proud, manly truth that beamed
from him with Elise’s airy coldness?
</p>
<p>Elise was very busy serving out her liqueurs, and she asked Vincent whether he drank
Kirsch or <span class="corr" id="xd31e4687" title="Source: Curaçoa">Curaçao</span>, or whether he perhaps preferred cognac. Vincent sat down by the fire, beside her
and Uncle Daniel, while St. Clare seated himself by the window next to Eline.
</p>
<p>“And you are the nice little cousin, then, of whom Vincent has told me so much? The
little cousin who nursed him so well?” he asked with a smile, as he placed his hands
in his pockets, and with his clear, frank eyes looked penetratingly into Eline’s.
</p>
<p>“Yes, I am the cousin who nursed him,” she answered in French. She spoke very good
English, but his French pleased her, so that she did not ask him whether he preferred
speaking English.
</p>
<p>“That was at the Hague, was it not?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, at the Hague. He was then staying at my brother-in-law’s.”
</p>
<p>“And you were also staying with your brother-in-law, were you not?”
</p>
<p>It seemed as if he were trying to pump her a little; but the manner in which he did
it had so little of indiscretion about it and so much of interest that she did not
feel hurt.
</p>
<p>“Yes,” she answered. “Did Vincent tell you so?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, Vincent often spoke to me about you.”
</p>
<p>His words gave her the impression that he knew a great deal about her life. After
her flight from Betsy’s house she had written Vincent, and no doubt St. Clare knew
of it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>“And you have travelled a good deal, have you not?” he continued.
</p>
<p>“Yes, with uncle and aunt. You also think of travelling, do you not?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, as far as Russia next winter.”
</p>
<p>Both were silent for a moment. It seemed to Eline as if they had much to say to each
other, and did not know where to start. To her it seemed as if she had long known
him, and now it appeared too that he knew her. They were no longer strangers to each
other.
</p>
<p>“Do you care very much for Vincent?” she asked.
</p>
<p>“I like him very much. I feel much sympathy and pity for him. If his health had been
more robust he would have made his mark. In him there is much energy and elasticity,
and his views are very broad, but his physical weakness prevents him from giving his
mind to any one thing and bringing it to completion. Most people misunderstand Vincent.
They think him indolent, capricious, selfish; and they will not acknowledge that the
explanation of it all is to be found in the fact that he is weak and ill. I defy the
greatest and the best of us to be active and determined to turn his gifts and talents
to good use if he is half dying with weakness.”
</p>
<p>This was a light in which she had never viewed Vincent. The only thing she could say
was that she had felt an unaccountable sympathy for him.
</p>
<p>“Yes, I think you are right,” she said, after a short pause. “But do you not think
that such a long journey will fatigue him too much? Russia, in the winter?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, no, not at all; the cold climate is good for his temperament, and he need not
fatigue himself—there is no work for him to do; as for mere railway travelling, he
is used to it. He need only wrap himself up in his furs and lie back in his carriage.
That is all.”
</p>
<p>From his words she suspected, as she had suspected from her conversation with Vincent,
that St. Clare was in the habit of surrounding him with every possible comfort and
luxury.
</p>
<p>“I must say I think you are rather kind-hearted,” she could not help remarking.
</p>
<p>He looked at her for a moment in some surprise.
</p>
<p>“What makes you think of that all at once?” he asked laughing.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she answered, and she blushed and laughed a little. “One cannot help
getting certain impressions about people. Maybe I’m mistaken.”
</p>
<p>He raised his hands with a deprecatory motion. She felt that in her last words there
was just a shade of coquettishness, and now that she had spoken them it irritated
her.
</p>
<p>“You said just now something about energy and activity,” she resumed, “and you believe
that when one is ill one ought to be excused for showing no such energy and activity?”
</p>
<p>“Of course. What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>In his manner there was something penetrating, something that went ever straight to
its object, and it confused her somewhat. Had it been Vincent, she would very soon
have plunged into some more or less misty philosophical discussion, and lost herself
in a maze of sentences thin and filmy as cloudlets of steam—discussions in which neither
of them knew what they were really aiming at. But St. Clare threw her entirely off
her <i lang="fr">qui vive</i> with his “What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>“I mean,” she answered with much indecision, “whether you would not even be readier
to forgive one who had passed through great grief, that lack of energy and activity,
than—you would forgive Vincent, who has only been ill.”
</p>
<p>He looked at her fixedly for a moment.
</p>
<p>“Yes, I should, that is, if he had tried to be energetic and had failed in the attempt;
not otherwise, not if he had allowed himself, without an effort, to be dragged along
by the force of circumstances with the simple reflection that one cannot fight against
destiny. Vincent has some of that fatalism, and there is nothing that is so unnerving
as that. Life would degenerate into a moral lethargy if every one did so, and simply
sat down with folded hands and thought, ‘I cannot help it, come what may.’ ”
</p>
<p>Her thoughts wandered a little. In fact, she did not know what she thought. And she,
had she had any energy? Had she allowed herself to be dragged along by the force of
circumstances? She did not know. His strength of will, his determination, oppressed
and crushed her, and arrested the flow of her thoughts.
</p>
<p>“But if that person had gone through much suffering, if he had suffered, especially
with remorse, at what he once had done?” she whispered almost imploringly, with a
moist glitter in her eyes, and her little foot wandered nervously along the rug, her
fingers clutched <span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>at her black locket. His glance softened, filling with tenderness and pity.
</p>
<p>“In that case—yes, then I should forgive him all,” he whispered, with a merciful assurance.
</p>
<p>But his last words completely unnerved and abashed her. It suddenly seemed to her
as if she had entirely exposed herself, as if she had said things which she should
not have said, and yet it seemed as if the strength failed her to withdraw herself
now that she had said so much as that.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>After that day St. Clare and Vincent stayed away for about a week, and Eline began
to long for their return. When they came again it was the day before New Year’s Eve,
and Elise invited both for the following day, when she was giving a big <i lang="fr">soirée</i>.
</p>
<p>The following evening, about half-past nine, the guests arrived. Uncle Daniel and
Elise courteously welcomed their somewhat loosely-picked-up acquaintances. The young
men of the club, the count, the actor, the dueller and his blonde wife, were the first
to make their appearance; and after that Eline saw them pass in review before their
host and hostess, and a strange review it was. The gentlemen with something artificial
or Bohemian about them, the ladies with much too big diamonds, and in faded silken
trains. She did not feel herself at home at all in this circle, and yet she felt amused
by these strange folk, who wandered about the crowded salons, the light from the candles
in the Venetian chandelier glinting strangely over all that antique bronze, that antique
china, that antique furniture. And there was a variety about the guests that charmed
her. Eline withdrew herself a little when she saw St. Clare and Vincent approach.
They were in evening dress, and it struck her that there was something <i lang="fr">distingué</i> about them both. But after they had greeted uncle and Elise, they did not seem to
observe her among the noisy groups by which they were surrounded, and Eline felt herself
quite forsaken, although a little old lady, wrinkled and brown as a nut, with little
red plumes in her hair, eagerly conversed with her about painters and sculptors. The
old lady affected to be a great patron of struggling artists.
</p>
<p>“I suppose it is an artistic <i lang="fr">soirée</i> this evening?” she asked with blinking eyes.
</p>
<p>“I believe it is,” answered Eline, with growing irritation.
</p>
<p>“You sing, do you not?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Oh, no! I do not sing any more. The doctor has forbidden me to sing.”
</p>
<p>“I suppose you intended to go on the stage?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, no. Not at all.”
</p>
<p>Some gentlemen came forward and bowed to the old lady, and she introduced them to
Eline. They were very talented artists. Musicians, actors, painters, misunderstood
geniuses all of them. The little old lady overwhelmed Eline with operas, poems, panoramas
which they had written, created, and painted; their fame would ere long resound throughout
the world, for <i>she</i> would protect them.
</p>
<p>Eline felt as if all those misunderstood geniuses were hemming her in. Things began
to shimmer and dance before her eyes, and it was a relief when she saw St. Clare coming
towards her once more.
</p>
<p>“You are so surrounded,” he laughed softly, “one can scarcely penetrate.”
</p>
<p>Eline puckered up her little mouth contemptuously.
</p>
<p>“Let us move aside a little. There is more room there,” she lisped.
</p>
<p>She made her escape deftly from the circle of the geniuses, and with a sigh sank down
on a settee. Nervously her fingers played about the dull gold beads that covered her
low-necked corsage of black satin as with a glistening ray.
</p>
<p>“Oh, those people do bore me,” she said with light disdain. “What sort of time did
you spend in Ghent and in Bruges? Come, tell me something about it.”
</p>
<p>He remained standing beside her, and told her a little of his trip. Here and there
little groups formed themselves. The footman served wine and refreshments.
</p>
<p>“But what is to happen this evening, I wonder?” asked St. Clare with curiosity, as
he suddenly broke off his conversation.
</p>
<p>Elise was standing, all amiability, writhing herself into all sorts of bows and curtseys
before the count, and people looked round at them and whispered. The count seemed
bashful, and made some excuses.
</p>
<p>“No, don’t disappoint me, pray,” Elise was heard to say in a beseeching tone.
</p>
<p>“I suppose she is asking him to recite something, and he is shy,” laughed Eline.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>Eline was right. Elise cast a glance of triumph in the direction of some of the ladies,
and the count, with a movement as if he could not help it, assumed an attitude and
coughed. He would recite an epic poem, Pizarro’s account of the conquest of Mexico,
of Montezuma, and the Aztecs.
</p>
<p>A silence ensued, tempered with a low whispering. The stanzas rolled in thundering
tones over the heads of the guests with a harsh rumbling of <i>r</i>’s.
</p>
<p>Vincent, from another corner of the room, nodded at Eline archly. The count began
to shout louder and louder.
</p>
<p>“Magnificent! don’t you think so?” asked the little old lady with the red plumes,
who had once more come back to Eline.
</p>
<p>Eline nodded approvingly, but here and there a cough was heard, and despairing faces
were to be seen all over the room. The whispering, too, grew a little louder.
</p>
<p>“Patience and resignation,” Eline said to St. Clare with a smile.
</p>
<p>He smiled in return, and she no longer found the immense poem so unbearably boring
now that he stood by her side. When the count’s last stanza had died away a sort of
electric movement began to be manifest among the erstwhile motionless groups. They
laughed and they talked and they pushed one another. Some ladies were expressing their
thanks to the count with a great show of rapture.
</p>
<p>“Could we not devise some protection against his next attack?” asked St. Clare laughing.
</p>
<p>“We shall be freer in the conservatory,” said Eline.
</p>
<p>With some trouble they threaded their way to the little conservatory. There were only
two little groups—two old gentlemen seated at the table covered with empty wine-glasses,
and a little woman in active conversation with a young man. There prevailed a soft
balsamic odour which permeated as with a breath from the tropics the palms and the
Vanilla plants and the orchids that were crowded together in rich profusion. Outside
a snowstorm was showering around its flakes of downy white. They had scarcely sat
down before they heard some chords struck on the piano in the adjoining room. The
actor, a bass, was about to sing a duet with the fair-haired jeweller’s wife. St.
Clare and Eline could see them standing by the piano, their figures reflected in the
mirrors of the conservatory, while one of the misunderstood composers was to accompany
them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I had no idea that she sang,” Eline exclaimed in surprise. “<i lang="fr">La bonne surprise!</i> it’s really getting amusing, but don’t stop talking.”
</p>
<p>A blush rose to her cheek, and something of her former sparkling fascination came
back to her. Now and then she lifted her champagne glass to her lips. In close attention
she listened to his stories. He spoke so well. Yonder the high shrieks of the soprano
and the low growling of the bass intermingled with overpowering if somewhat ludicrous
effect. The conservatory gradually filled with little groups who were making their
escape from the drawing-room. Vincent came to join St. Clare and Eline.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Je ne <span class="corr" id="xd31e4808" title="Source: derange">dérange</span> pas?</i>” asked he.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Par exemple!</i>” cried Eline.
</p>
<p>It seemed as if the three of them had found themselves at some public fête. They scarcely
knew one among all those curious people, and they amused themselves by laughing a
little at them. The two old gentlemen’s collection of empty wine-glasses seemed to
have grown larger and larger, and under the shady leaves of a banana the young man
could be seen with his arm furtively encircling the waist of the little woman. In
the other corner, where some glasses had just been broken, Vincent recognized some
one, who posed as a Russian prince, engaged in boisterous chat with two circus-riders,
and he could not understand how they could have been admitted even to Uncle Daniel’s
drawing-room.
</p>
<p>“Oh, they must have entered through a back door. I’m sure Elise cannot know that they
are here,” laughed Eline.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>In the salon the programme was proceeding. They sang, they recited, both serious and
comic pieces, but the stillness of admiration grew less and less. In the conservatory
the Russian prince ran after the circus-riders, and tried to embrace them; and the
two old gentlemen all at once broke out in a terribly angry dispute. The young couple
had disappeared.
</p>
<p>“I should advise you to return a little closer to your uncle and aunt. The company
is certainly getting rather mixed here,” said St. Clare to Eline.
</p>
<p>Vincent had left them. Eline rose a little anxiously, and St. Clare followed her.
But in the salon Elise was surrounded by a very noisy group, of which the ladies smoked
cigarettes and spilt more champagne on their dresses than they drank. St. Clare led
Eline to the terrace. His eyes sparkled and his lips twitched <span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>nervously as his glance fell on the group by which Elise was surrounded.
</p>
<p>“How did you really get here?” he suddenly asked Eline in a tone of dissatisfaction
which he could not hide. “How is it possible that I could have met you here?”
</p>
<p>She looked at him in astonishment.
</p>
<p>“I ask you how it is possible that I could have found you here? You are certainly
not in proper company.”
</p>
<p>She began to see his meaning, and started at the boldness of his question.
</p>
<p>“Not in proper company,” she slowly repeated. “May I remind you that I am at the house
of my uncle and aunt?”
</p>
<p>“I know that. But your uncle and aunt, it seems to me, are in the habit of receiving
people who are not fit company for you. You are here with the consent of your relations,
I suppose?”
</p>
<p>She began to tremble all over, and her eyes were fixed upon him with all the haughtiness
that she could at that moment muster up.
</p>
<p>“May I ask you, Mr. St. Clare, by what right you place me under cross-examination?
I thought I was free to do as I pleased, and am old enough to choose my friends without
anybody’s consent, either that of my relations or of yourself.”
</p>
<p>Her tone was sharp and cutting. She was about to turn away. He took her hand, she
quickly withdrew it.
</p>
<p>“Do stay a moment, pray. Forgive me if I have hurt you. But I take an interest in
you, I have heard so much about you from Vincent. I knew you, in fact, before I had
seen you. I looked upon you somewhat—somewhat, if I may say it, as a little sister,
just as I thought of Vincent as my brother; and now I find you here, mixed with people——”
</p>
<p>“Thank you very much for your good intentions,” she resumed with icy coldness, “but
in future please to give expression to your brotherly interest in a more proper fashion.
You knew me before you had seen me, it is possible. I have known you now for a week,
and I cannot understand how you dare to speak to me as if you were called upon to
be my guardian. I am much obliged to you for your solicitude, but I do not need it.”
</p>
<p>He made a movement of impatience, and once more prevented her from going. She was
still trembling with rage, but she stayed.
</p>
<p>“Now do not be angry, pray,” he resumed appeasingly. “Perhaps <span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>I did speak rather boldly; but don’t you think yourself that the company here is not
suited to you?”
</p>
<p>“The acquaintances of my uncle and aunt may be mine as well, I should imagine. In
any case, it is a matter which does not concern you in the least.”
</p>
<p>“Why do you forbid me to take an interest in you?”
</p>
<p>“Because you take advantage.”
</p>
<p>“And is there no pardon for that when it is merely caused by a feeling of sincere
friendship?” he asked, and held out his hand.
</p>
<p>“Oh, certainly,” she answered coldly, apparently without noticing his hand. “But,
in future, pray spare me your feelings of friendship. Too much interest in one is
sometimes annoying.”
</p>
<p>Much hurt she turned away.
</p>
<p>He remained alone on the terrace, and he saw her disappear among the circus-riders
and the Russian prince, the fair-haired lady, the two drunken gentlemen, and the poetical
count.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now that the fête was over, she began to think over it all in the solitude of her
room. It was five o’clock, and she felt almost too tired to undress herself. She did
not feel so much hurt because of his presumption. But—that evening, for the first
time after so long a period of lethargy, she had forgotten her sorrows a little. She
had found a little amusement, and been somewhat of her former self again, and he had
embittered that innocent pleasure by reminding her that she was in a circle to which
she was not suited. Did she not know that as well as he? and it was just because she
knew it—because she felt that he was right—because he felt as she felt herself, that
she was hurt. Why had he not allowed her to pass a brief moment of happiness in peace?
Why had he spoken to her about her relations? What did Henk and Betsy care if she
did throw herself away among the curious acquaintances of uncle and Elise? But she
did not do so, she had scarcely spoken a word to any one except Vincent and himself.
She had only amused herself at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb279">[<a href="#pb279">279</a>]</span>expense of a circle which surrounded her. She threw herself in her black satin dress
on a chair, and, as she thought about that which had given her offence, she felt it
gradually evaporating like a cloud of mist. But still she wanted to feel hurt; yes,
she did feel hurt, very much hurt indeed. Yet after all it was not so very bad. It
was for her sake that he had felt so annoyed at the strange coterie in which she found
herself. He had shown her his annoyance so frankly, and she could still hear him say
in that discontented voice—
</p>
<p>“How did you get here? Are you here with the consent of your relations?”
</p>
<p>He took an interest in her, genuine interest, with all the haughty pride of his sunny,
truthful temperament, and a great desire suddenly overmastered her to go to him and
ask his pardon, his counsel. It would be delicious to conform herself entirely to
his will; it would mean peace, much-longed-for peace and calm. About twelve o’clock,
after a short sleep, she entered the room with a pale face and dark blue circles under
her eyes, and found Elise, with a couple of the servants, busy rearranging the disorder
which the orgies of the previous evening had brought about. Elise was very satisfied
with her <i lang="fr">soirée</i>, and wished Eline a happy new year. Uncle Daniel was out.
</p>
<p>“What a number of glasses they broke! If you want to breakfast, Eline, you must go
to the dining-room. Here you are only in my way. Pardon me for saying so. But it was
very jolly yesterday, was it not?”
</p>
<p>Eline went to the dining-room. She ate something and remained a little while idling.
She waited for some one—for St. Clare—but neither Vincent nor he came, nor did they
come the following day, nor the next. If Eline had dared she would have written him.
</p>
<p>While she dreamily awaited his arrival she received a letter from Madame van Raat,
who wrote her, that although he was living at Bodegraven just now, she saw Paul occasionally,
and that he seemed to have some secret grief which she could not guess. She was very
sorry that a kind of estrangement had come between her and her son, and she doubted
whether she had always shown him sufficient tenderness.
</p>
<p>“She not enough tenderness!” thought Eline, “why she was all tenderness, at least
to me.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span></p>
<p>When she came to the end of the letter she started violently. Jeanne Ferelyn had died
in Bangil. Eline’s eyes filled with tears.
</p>
<p>“Great heavens! Great heavens!” she repeated slowly, and a nervous sob shook her frame.
Her poor friend was dead! Oh! how tenderly Jeanne had nursed her when she was prostrate
with bronchitis in that little home of theirs! How gentle and loving Jeanne had always
been! How affectionate she was to herself and her children. And now she was dead!
What happiness had her life brought her? None—none at all! And Madame van Raat, she
had her sorrows. Paul had his. What was life but one great sorrow?
</p>
<p>She sobbed violently over the letter, and could not reconcile herself to the thought
that Jeanne was dead. Jeanne is dead! Jeanne is dead! It was hissing in her ears and
in her brain. She had so much to thank Jeanne for, and she would never see her again,
for Jeanne was dead! Oh, great heavens, she was dead!
</p>
<p>She threw herself back in her chair and covered her face with her hands. But suddenly
she heard steps in the adjoining room. She looked up, and ere she could recover herself
saw St. Clare appearing in the door. Half demented with grief, with her weeping eyes
she glanced at him.
</p>
<p>“I hope you will pardon me if I disturb you.”
</p>
<p>He spoke softly, for he saw that she was crying. “The servant said that you were at
home. Perhaps I had better come back to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>She rose, wiped her eyes, and gave him a friendly smile.
</p>
<p>“Do you wish to go so soon?” she said sadly. “You do not disturb me in the least.
On the contrary, I think it very nice of you that you have come. Take a seat. Is Vincent
all right?”
</p>
<p>“Very well, thank you,” he answered, in a tone from which she could gather all the
friendship he felt for Vincent. “We have been to Liège and Verviers.”
</p>
<p>“Is that the only reason then why I have not seen you before now after the <i lang="fr">soirée</i>?”
</p>
<p>He looked at her for a moment.
</p>
<p>“Yes,” he answered, “the only reason.”
</p>
<p>“You were not angry?”
</p>
<p>“No, not at all. I was in the wrong. I should not have spoken like that. You were
quite right.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb281">[<a href="#pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I am not sure,” she said. “I know I must have offended you with my unmannerliness.
Will you forgive me, or do you refuse me your hand as I have refused you mine?”
</p>
<p>She gave him her hand. He pressed it closely.
</p>
<p>“I will forgive you gladly,” he answered, “and I think it very nice of you that you
confess that you have been a little in the wrong.”
</p>
<p>“And in future, will you please take that interest in me which you said you did when
last I saw you. Will you believe me if I tell you that your interest in me and your
friendship will not annoy me as I told you it did then? May I depend upon that?”
</p>
<p>“Certainly you may.”
</p>
<p>“Thank you. Thank you very much. I was not deceived when I told you that you had a
kind heart. You are more than kind, you are noble.”
</p>
<p>He laughed a little.
</p>
<p>“What big words you do use,” he said jestingly. “You’re becoming so dignified.”
</p>
<p>“No,” she said determinedly. “I’m not dignified, and I use no big words. I mean what
I say. You do not know what pleasure it gives me to see you and to hear from you that
you are not angry with me, especially at this moment. I was feeling so terribly unhappy.”
</p>
<p>“You were crying, I believe.”
</p>
<p>The tears dropped from her lashes.
</p>
<p>“I have just now heard of the death of a very dear friend, a poor, weak little thing
she was, but she was so useful. She will be so terribly missed by her husband and
children. It is always thus in the world, is it not? People who are of use, they die,
and those who, like myself, are a trouble to every one and a misery to themselves,
live on.”
</p>
<p>“Why do you speak so sadly? Are you then of use to no one? Do you care for no one,
and is there no one who cares for you?”
</p>
<p>She laughed bitterly.
</p>
<p>“But surely there are people who take an interest in you?” he continued.
</p>
<p>“What shall I answer you? I have no parents. About my sister I dare say you have heard
something from Vincent. Do you know that I—ran away from—my brother-in-law’s house?”
</p>
<p>“Yes.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb282">[<a href="#pb282">282</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Ever since that time I have done nothing but wander about. I have always been with
strange people. Uncle and aunt have taken me under their roof, but still they are
strange. At the Hague I lived with an old lady, the mother of my brother-in-law; she
was very kind to me and I liked her very much, but I was not kind to her.”
</p>
<p>“I pity you very much,” said he. “I wish I could do something for you. But suppose
you sought some occupation? Is it not because you have nothing to do that you feel
yourself unhappy?”
</p>
<p>“I sought an occupation at the Hague. I travelled a good deal, and yet I felt myself
unhappy. It is all my own fault, you see; I have thrown away my own happiness.”
</p>
<p>She began to cry, her head resting in her hands.
</p>
<p>“Tell me, cannot I do something for you?” he insisted.
</p>
<p>“Nothing at all, thank you. No one can do anything for me.”
</p>
<p>“But it is really not right to bury oneself in one’s grief, and to think of nothing
else. You may not do so. You must rouse yourself from your sorrows. Every one has
his troubles. Come, promise me that in future you will think otherwise.”
</p>
<p>“I cannot,” she sobbed, “I am so weak. I am broken down, broken down utterly.”
</p>
<p>In her words there sounded such a hopelessness that he did not know what to say, but
he brimmed over with pity—a pity that was mingled with despair at the thought that
he could do nothing for her—and he would solace and comfort her, whatever it might
cost.
</p>
<p>“No,” said he with determination, “you are not broken down—that is a mere idea! You
are young, and have a life before you. Break with your past, forget it completely.”
</p>
<p>“Oh! how can I do that?” she sobbed. “How is it possible?”
</p>
<p>He knew he was wrong himself. He knew that the sorrowful memories of the past were
all but indelible.
</p>
<p>“I feel such a pity for you,” he repeated, “a pity such as I have never yet felt for
any one before.”
</p>
<p>“That is the only thing left you that you can do for me, pity me,” she exclaimed passionately;
“pity me, that does me good. For have you not told me that you knew me already before
you saw me, that I was to you like an unknown little sister?”
</p>
<p>He had risen from his seat, he laid his hands on her shoulders, and looked at her.
</p>
<p>“Certainly,” he replied cordially. And she could have died for <span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>him, so intensely grateful did she feel. “And now you are no longer unknown to me,
and anything I can do for you I will do. You must tell me all about yourself, and
if you will leave it to me, I will make you forget your miseries.”
</p>
<p>He just tapped her on the shoulder like an old friend. In her heart there arose a
great regret that they had not known each other sooner. What a happiness it had been
to her but a little while ago when she humbled herself before him, when she begged
him for his pardon.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>A week elapsed, during which the Veres saw neither Vincent nor St. Clare, as they
were away a few days in Holland. There was a talk of a masquerade ball to be given
by the count. Uncle Daniel would not go in fancy costume, but Elise would go in Eastern
dress; and Eline, whose fancy did not soar very high just now, would accompany her,
also in Eastern dress.
</p>
<p>A day before the ball the two young men came back. Eline thought she could see a frown
pass over St. Clare’s features when he heard that they were going to that ball. He
said nothing, however; but the following evening, about half-past eight, he came in
with Vincent. They had also been invited. Vincent had accepted the invitation. St.
Clare had not. He asked to see Eline for a moment, but she had just commenced her
toilette; but St. Clare was importunate, and Eline sent her maid down to ask him to
wait.
</p>
<p>In the big salon there was no one. Vincent, in evening dress, was lying on the couch,
and had taken up <i lang="fr">L’Indépendance</i>. St. Clare stood on the balcony thinking, and he stared at the snow which glistened
in the evening light. A servant came and asked whether they would have tea.
</p>
<p>“I must say I admire your pluck, Lawrence,” said Vincent in English, as he slowly
stirred his cup of tea. “But are you certain that all would go well?”
</p>
<p>“Well, I can’t help myself. I <i>will</i> have it so,” answered St. Clare determinedly.
</p>
<p>The servant left and both were silent, when Eline entered. A pink glow of veloutine
hid the sallow tint of her complexion. Her hair was already arranged, and rows and
rows of glittering sequins hung over her brow. But further than that she had not yet
proceeded with her costume, and was simply wrapped in a white <span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>flannel peignoir. Vincent rose, and she apologized for her toilette. But she was very
charming.
</p>
<p>“You wanted so urgently to speak to me,” she said softly to St. Clare, as she held
out her hand to him. “You won’t mind that I’ve come to you like this; and keep your
seat, please.”
</p>
<p>They sat down, while Vincent withdrew with his newspaper into the conservatory. St.
Clare looked at Eline searchingly.
</p>
<p>“What is it you want to ask me?” she said.
</p>
<p>“In the first place, I must ask your pardon for my boldness in having called you away
from your toilette.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, that is nothing. I have plenty of time.”
</p>
<p>“I feel very much flattered that you have come at once. You can well imagine that
I should not have intruded if it had not been for a very good reason. I had a request
to make you.”
</p>
<p>“Which admitted of no delay?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, that admitted of no delay, and I run the risk that you will be very angry when
I make that request, that you will feel hurt, and that you will tell me that I am
interfering in matters that do not concern me.”
</p>
<p>She had a vague suspicion of the question that he was about to utter.
</p>
<p>“Never mind. Speak up frankly,” she simply answered.
</p>
<p>“You’ve asked me to show as much interest in you as a brother would show for a sister.
Is that right, or am I mistaken?”
</p>
<p>“No, that is quite right.”
</p>
<p>“Well, if you were my sister, I would ask you to do me a great favour, and beg of
you not to go to that ball this evening.” She did not answer, but looked him straight
in the face. “If you were my sister I should tell you that Vincent and I have made
inquiries about the people who are coming to the ball this evening; I should tell
you that I know for certain that a great number of the invited guests are even less
suited to your circle than some of your uncle’s and aunt’s acquaintances. If you were
my sister, I could scarcely express myself in plainer terms than I have done, and
I have not a word to add to what I have said; but I hope that you will not misunderstand
me, and that you will now have some idea what kind of guests they will be whom you
would see there this evening.”
</p>
<p>She cast down her eyes and remained silent.
</p>
<p>“And, therefore, at the risk of interfering in a matter that does not concern me,
at the risk that your uncle and aunt will take <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>offence at my interference in your affairs, at the risk that you yourself, after having
forgiven me one indiscretion already, will be very angry with me, I ask you once more,
do not go to this ball. You are out of place there.”
</p>
<p>Still she remained silent, and her fingers clutched nervously at the girdle of her
peignoir.
</p>
<p>“Are you very angry,” he asked.
</p>
<p>“No,” she answered after a pause, very softly. “No, I am not angry, and I shall do
as you ask me. I shall not go.”
</p>
<p>“Do you really mean it?” he cried delighted.
</p>
<p>“I really mean it. I shall not go. I am very thankful to you that you have inquired
about the people who are coming. I was already afraid that you would not approve of
my going, but I could not bear the thought of staying alone at home a whole evening;
that always makes me so melancholy.”
</p>
<p>“You feared my disapproval?” he asked smilingly.
</p>
<p>“Yes,” she answered. “You are such a good friend to me, that I should not like to
do anything of which you disapprove. And for this evening—I shall do exactly as you
require.”
</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he said with emotion, and pressed her hand.
</p>
<p>“Yes, you may well appreciate it,” she cried with forced airiness, feeling somewhat
depressed by her humility. “Do you know that, for the last three-quarters of an hour,
I have been busy arranging the sequins in my hair, and all for nothing?”
</p>
<p>“Certainly, I appreciate what you have done. I assure you I appreciate it,” he declared
with much earnestness.
</p>
<p>Uncle Daniel entered the room<span class="corr" id="xd31e4987" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Bon soir</i>, St. Clare. You are not coming, are you? But, Eline! Are not you going to dress?”
</p>
<p>Eline stammered something and could not find her words, when she heard the voice of
Elise, who was grumbling to the maid. Elise entered, glittering with sequins and Moorish
draperies, her feet encased in two little slippers.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Bon soir</i>, St. Clare. What a pity you are not going. It will be very nice—<i>Ciel</i>! Eline!”
</p>
<p>Vincent came in from the conservatory.
</p>
<p>“It is nearly half-past nine, and you have only as yet done your hair,” continued
Elise in blank astonishment. “What have you been thinking about?”
</p>
<p>“I don’t think that your cousin is going, madam,” said St. <span class="pageNum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>Clare, as Eline was too confused to speak. “We heard, Vincent and I, that the company
would be rather mixed at the ball—and I advised Miss Vere not to go rather than risk
unpleasant encounters. I hope you will pardon me for giving that advice. Of course,
I know she would have been under your protection and that of her uncle, but I thought
that such circles were even more to be avoided by a young girl than by a married lady,
even though she be as charming as yourself. Was I very wrong?”
</p>
<p>Elise hesitated whether she should be angry or not, but in his voice there was so
much determination and at the same time so much that was winning, that she felt herself
completely disarmed. Daniel Vere just shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>“Whether you were wrong?” Elise repeated, still hesitating. “Well, perhaps not. Of
course Eline can do as she likes. If she would rather not go, <i lang="fr">eh bien, soit!</i> then we shall pretend that she had a headache. That is easy enough. But you will
have a terrible <i>ennui</i>, Eline.”
</p>
<p>“No, really, I would much rather stay at home,” said Eline; “at least, that is, if
you are not offended.”
</p>
<p>“Not at all. <i lang="fr">Liberté chérie</i>, child.”
</p>
<p>The servant came in to say that the carriage was at the door, and brought uncle’s
and Vincent’s furs. The maid assisted Elise to her fur cape.
</p>
<p>“If your uncle and aunt have no objection, I should like to keep you company for a
little while?” asked St. Clare.
</p>
<p>Uncle and aunt thought it excellent. Eline was still rather confused.
</p>
<p>“Adieu! Much pleasure,” she said with a little furtive smile to Elise, her uncle,
and Vincent.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“Ridiculous,” muttered Uncle Daniel, when they were in the carriage. “Ridiculous!
He won’t allow her to go to the ball, but he does not mind keeping her company. That
is American fashion, I suppose. I, at least, would like to know which is more improper?
To go with us to the ball, or to spend an evening alone with a young man? Ridiculous!”
</p>
<p>Vincent said nothing. He thought it beneath him to defend his friend, but Elise quickly
urged her husband to be silent. She would not permit him to speak ill of a cousin
who was under his roof, and of a friend whom they saw so frequently.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Speak ill of him—oh dear, no!” resumed Uncle Daniel, still feeling hurt. “’Tis only
American fashion, I suppose.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Eline still felt her confusion.
</p>
<p>“I don’t think uncle thought it right that I followed your advice,” she said, when
they were alone. “Perhaps, too, he thought that—you should have gone with them.”
</p>
<p>St. Clare looked at her in quiet surprise.
</p>
<p>“Then why did he not say so? I asked him, did I not? But would you sooner have me
go?”
</p>
<p>“No, I should think it very kind of you if you stayed a little longer.”
</p>
<p>“With pleasure! for there is something else that I would like to ask you, but it is
not of such importance this time.”
</p>
<p>“What is it, then?”
</p>
<p>“I should like one of those sequins which you have arranged in your hair.”
</p>
<p>Eline smiled, and carefully she took from her hair the row of sequins and removed
one of the coins, which she offered to him.
</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he said, and attached the coin to his watch-chain.
</p>
<p>A strange feeling came over Eline. She felt very contented, very happy, and yet somewhat
abashed, and she asked herself which Betsy would have considered less proper: to go
with her uncle and aunt to that ball, or to spend the evening alone, and <i lang="fr">en négligé</i>, even with St. Clare? The latter certainly, she thought. But he seemed to think it
so simple and natural that she did not even venture to ask him whether she might go
and change her dress.
</p>
<p>“And now let us have a little quiet chat,” he said, as he sat down in a fauteuil,
and she remained sitting on the sofa, still a little shy, and playing with her row
of sequins. “Tell me something, do—of your childhood, or of your travels.”
</p>
<p>She said she did not know what to tell him, but again he asked her. She answered him,
and slowly her confidence in herself came back, and she told him of Aunt Vere, of
her Ouida literature, and especially of her father and his great canvases which he
never completed. She told him also of her singing, of Betsy and Henk, and added that
formerly she thought very differently from what she thought now, and that she appeared
different too.
</p>
<p>“What is it you call formerly?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb288">[<a href="#pb288">288</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I mean before my illness, and before I went travelling with uncle and aunt—before—my
engagement.”
</p>
<p>“And how did you look then?”
</p>
<p>“Much healthier and—and fresher.”
</p>
<p>“Prettier, you would say?”
</p>
<p>She could not help laughing that he read her thoughts, and did not give himself the
least trouble to be gallant. Then she asked him whether he would like to see her portraits
of those days, and while she took an album from the table, she thought she might just
as well permit him to call her by her name. But she could not get so far as that.
</p>
<p>He turned the pages of the album, which contained many of her portraits; delicate
little heads, with a ribbon or a string of pearls round the neck. In a few of them
she was <i lang="fr">décolletée</i>.
</p>
<p>“Well—what do you think?” she asked, as he remained silent.
</p>
<p>“Very charming little faces, all of them, but everywhere an intolerable coquettish
little smile. A prettiness much too artificial. Were you always in the habit of posing
thus, or did you only do so before a photographer?”
</p>
<p>She felt a little piqued.
</p>
<p>“For shame! How rude you are!” she said reproachfully.
</p>
<p>“Was I rude?” he asked. “I beg your pardon. Yes, ’tis true these are your portraits.
I was a little confused at the moment, for you see it is rather difficult to recognize
you in them. But, believe me—I should have thought you unbearable had I ever seen
you thus. Pretty, yes—but unbearable. Now you are a little thinner, it’s true, you
have the traces of suffering, but there is something winning in your face; while in
these little faces here there is nothing but coquettishness. I would rather see you
as you are now.”
</p>
<p>He closed the album, and laid it down.
</p>
<p>“And yourself,” he resumed, “would you rather be as you were then? Do you regret those
days?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” she sighed, “then I was not happy either.”
</p>
<p>“But now you will do your best to be happy, will you not?”
</p>
<p>She gave a little laugh and shrugged her shoulders.
</p>
<p>“One cannot force one’s happiness,” she murmured dreamily, and, involuntarily, she
said it in English.
</p>
<p>He looked at her in astonishment.
</p>
<p>“Do you speak English?” he asked.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I?” she cried in French, aroused from her dream.
</p>
<p>“Yes, you!”
</p>
<p>“Am I speaking English?”
</p>
<p>“Not now. But just now you were.”
</p>
<p>“Was I speaking English? I did not know—”
</p>
<p>“Why have you never spoken English to me?”
</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes, you do know.”
</p>
<p>“No, really not.”
</p>
<p>“I assure you that you do know. Now tell me why, come!”
</p>
<p>She laughed a little amused laugh.
</p>
<p>“Because you speak such jolly French. You have such a pretty accent.”
</p>
<p>“Then you have always laughed at me in secret?”
</p>
<p>“No, I assure you, really I have not.”
</p>
<p>“Which will you speak in future, English or French?”
</p>
<p>“French, or you will still think that I was laughing at you.”
</p>
<p>“There is no logic at all in what you say.”
</p>
<p>“Possibly, but still I will speak French.”
</p>
<p>“Very well. Do you know, you are no longer so weak as you were. You are getting better,
stronger.”
</p>
<p>“Why?”
</p>
<p>“For the first time since I have known you, I have heard you say I will. Now mark
my words. You commence by getting a little will of your own, and in the end you will
be quite firm, and when your will is firm and strong you will get strong yourself.
Now promise me that you will cultivate a little will, like a frail hothouse plant
that requires much care and attention.”
</p>
<p>Again she laughed, in her gentle, winning way.
</p>
<p>“You shall see. I shall grow astonishingly obstinate under your influence.”
</p>
<p>“No. I hope not. But I should be very happy indeed if you would get a little stronger
under my influence.”
</p>
<p>“I shall do my best.”
</p>
<p>“And I shall keep you to your word. It is nearly eleven.”
</p>
<p>She was silent. The word “already” was on her lips, but she restrained herself in
time.
</p>
<p>“And tell me frankly, don’t you think now that you will act much more sensibly by
going to bed early this evening, and trying to get a little sleep, than you would
have done if you had gone and danced <span class="pageNum" id="pb290">[<a href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>till six o’clock in the morning with very queer partners, and in the company of still
queerer ladies?”
</p>
<p>“You are perfectly right. I am sincerely grateful to you.”
</p>
<p>“And I, too, am grateful for the coin which you have given me.”
</p>
<p>She felt that it was not only for the coin that he was grateful.
</p>
<p>“And now good-night. Good-night, Eline.”
</p>
<p>She looked at him, and her eyes softened when she thus heard him pronounce her name,
without her permission.
</p>
<p>“Good-night, Lawrence,” she whispered. She held out her hand. For a moment he held
it in his, his eyes looking into hers. Then he released the little thin fingers.
</p>
<p>“Adieu,” said he with a last cordial nod, and left.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>For a while she stood still and mused. Then she told the servant to extinguish the
gas in the salon, and retired to her bed-room. The sequins she took from her hair
and placed on the toilet-table. On a chair lay the glistening draperies of her ball
toilet, and her little Moorish slippers were on the floor beside it. While she undressed,
she still heard his voice with its light accent. Slowly she arranged her ornaments.
Her eye fell on her watch, to the chain of which a black locket was attached. She
opened it and gazed into it for a long while, and her eyes grew moist. Then she pressed
a soft kiss on the likeness which it contained. For a moment she thought of detaching
it from its chain and placing it in one of the little drawers of her jewel-case; but
she did not do so. She lay down in her bed; she did not sleep, neither did she take
her sleeping draught. At half-past five she heard Elise, sighing with fatigue, returning
with Uncle Daniel. But her sleeplessness had not been disturbed by grim nightmares,
and it seemed to her as though a calm pink glow of light was diffused around her.
Later on she slept a little, and when she awoke she did not feel herself quite so
languid as she usually did on awaking.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Eline did not see Elise the following day before lunch. Uncle Daniel had gone out
already; he was always very busy, but nobody knew exactly what his occupations were.
Eline asked Elise whether she had enjoyed herself.
</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Elise in a kindly tone. “It was rather boisterous, and perhaps it’s
quite as well that you did not go. It might have upset you. Did St. Clare stay long?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb291">[<a href="#pb291">291</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Till eleven.”
</p>
<p>“Look here, it does not matter to me that he persuaded you to stay at home, but Daniel
found it rather foolish of you that you were so obedient. Still he does not care either,
you know. You are free to do exactly as you like with us, you know that.”
</p>
<p>Eline was silent.
</p>
<p>“But you must admit,” Elise proceeded laughingly, “it’s a strange case. Yes, certainly,
Eline, it’s a strange case, and sets one thinking.”
</p>
<p>Eline looked at her searchingly.
</p>
<p>“What do you think, then?”
</p>
<p>“My dear girl, that I keep to myself, that I won’t tell you. But I, who, as you know,
never think, I certainly do begin to think a little now. But I do not want to intimidate
you, you know. I think it’s a very good thing, if what I think is true.”
</p>
<p>Eline knew that she was referring to something which in her own mind was only just
rising in very vague shape. She remained silent, and while Elise, who was still rather
tired from the ball, threw herself on the couch with a book and was soon asleep, she
sat down by the window and collected her thoughts. In the last few days she had thought
little, she had merely allowed herself to be dragged along by a sweet tenderness which
had overwhelmed her; but now Elise’s veiled words brought her to herself again. Yes,
the case gave food for thought. St. Clare had dared to ask her to stay at home, and
she had yielded to his wishes, and <span class="corr" id="xd31e5149" title="Source: she">the</span> thought that it awakened in her mind she did not dare to shape. Gladly as she would
have yielded herself to that thought, she knew that it could never be, never. Oh,
why had she not met him sooner? Fate was cruel indeed. She began to fear that she
should have treated him differently, perhaps she ought to have repelled him with haughty
coldness, with indignation at his interference in her affairs, neither should she
have asked his pardon after she had once been cold to him. But it had been so sweet
to bend to his will; he was so strong, and she found so much support in his strength.
She had never imagined that he could have felt any love for her—ailing, weak, broken-down
creature that she was; it was not right, he ought not to have begun to care for her,
but now perhaps it was too late.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>When, a few days later, she saw him again, he found her alone <span class="pageNum" id="pb292">[<a href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>in the large salon. Eline was seated in an arm-chair by the fire, whilst a furious
wind was driving the snowflakes against the window-pane.
</p>
<p>“I knew I should find you at home. That is why I have come,” said he, as he took his
seat. “Have your uncle and aunt gone out?”
</p>
<p>“Yes; I don’t know where they have gone. I believe to a sale.”
</p>
<p>She had made up her mind to be a little distant in her manner, but his company was
so welcome to her that she did not succeed. She said, “I am very glad to see you again.”
</p>
<p>He smiled a little, and made a few remarks about the antique china which was scattered
about the room. Then he continued—
</p>
<p>“Soon I shall be leaving you for long; we are going northward viâ Cologne and Berlin.”
</p>
<p>It was as if the breath were choked within her.
</p>
<p>“When do you go?” she asked mechanically.
</p>
<p>“In a few days.”
</p>
<p>“You are going as far as St. Petersburg, as far as Moscow, are you not?”
</p>
<p>“Yes.”
</p>
<p>“Does Russia attract you?”
</p>
<p>He answered a little absently, in short, halting sentences. While she listened, she
felt she could have cried, and his words sounded to her as if they were spoken through
a mist, and she heard him say, as if he were interrupting himself—
</p>
<p>“But I wanted to ask you something. I wanted to ask you if, during the time that I
am away, you will now and then think of me.”
</p>
<p>“Certainly I will think of you,” she said with trembling lips; “you have been so good
and so kind to me, and—I shall always hold you in pleasant memory.”
</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he softly said. “Don’t you think it sad when people have learned to know
each other, and feel sympathy for one another, that they have to part?”
</p>
<p>“Yes. But there is so much that is sad in the world.”
</p>
<p>“You will say, perhaps,” he continued, following his own train of thought, “that I
can stay in Brussels as long as I like because I travel for my pleasure. Perhaps,
even, I should prefer to remain in Brussels.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span></p>
<p>She began to tremble all over, but she made an effort and restrained herself.
</p>
<p>“Why should you not go further?” she murmured. “Why should you not see what you can
of the world?”
</p>
<p>“Because I’m fond of you,” he answered calmly. And his penetrating eyes looked at
her fixedly. “And because I cannot bear to leave you. I should gladly stay with you,
stay with you always to protect you—I shudder at having to leave you. I have a feeling
when I think of my departure as if some misfortune would happen to you.”
</p>
<p>She wanted to reply something, but she could not, for she nearly choked in repressing
the tears that came to her eyes.
</p>
<p>“But that is impossible,” she said painfully, almost despairingly.
</p>
<p>“And why is it impossible?” he asked. “Why is it impossible that I should always stay
with you, or rather that you should always stay with me? Tell me, Eline.”
</p>
<p>“Because it cannot be,” she answered briefly.
</p>
<p>“Oh yes, it can; if you cared for me you would not say so. I should take you with
me. I should care for you. You should be my wife.”
</p>
<p>“And I—I should make you unhappy.”
</p>
<p>“No, no; I should do my very best to make you happy, and I’m certain that I should
succeed. Listen to me. Even before I had seen you, Vincent’s words made me feel an
interest in you. The first time that I met you I pitied you, for I saw in your whole
being that you had had a great grief, that you were still in grief, and that you were
unhappy. I began to think what I could do to make you happy, but I found nothing,
only while I was speaking to you, and while my mind was full of thoughts, it seemed
to me that there was a little more animation coming into your face, and more contentment
into your words. Perhaps it was only my fancy, but it seemed so to me. I imagined,
too—perhaps it was my vanity—that I myself somewhat influenced that change. I took
notice of you, though you spoke to other people, but at such times you were quiet,
cool, and reserved. But with me you were very different; you even grew confidential.
Then it was that a great desire came over me to be all in all to you, for I thought
perhaps then you would be happy, and would no longer take such a sombre view of life.
Elly, dear, you are still so young, and you imagine that all is over with you. Do
not think so any longer, but trust yourself to <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>me, and let us find out together whether life is really such a melancholy affair as
you imagined. Tell me, Elly, will you do so? Will you see with me whether an entirely
new life may not be yours?”
</p>
<p>She sobbed softly, lifted up her weeping eyes, and folded her hands almost in supplication.
</p>
<p>“Oh, why do you ask me that?” she cried. “Why must you ask me that? Why must I cause
you grief? Have I not given pain to enough people already? And now must I be a misery
to you as well? But it cannot be—it cannot be, never!”
</p>
<p>“Why not?”
</p>
<p>“Why not?” she repeated meditatively. “Because although I am still young, I am thoroughly
broken. Can you not see that? Because everything in me is shattered—because I am an
utter wreck.”
</p>
<p>“Eline, use no such big words; speak calmly.”
</p>
<p>“I use no big words. I do speak calmly. I speak with deliberation, with the deliberation
of despair,” she cried rising, and she remained standing before him as he took her
hand. “I speak with so much deliberation that it makes me shudder. Listen, Lawrence,
you know that I have been engaged.”
</p>
<p>“Yes. And that you have given him back his word.”
</p>
<p>“Yes. I have given him back his word, and yet I liked him. Even while I wrote to him
releasing him from his engagement, I liked him. Is that not terrible?”
</p>
<p>He did not answer, and looked at her as if he did not understand.
</p>
<p>“That you cannot understand, can you?” she asked, and her hands trembled in his. “You
cannot understand that such terrible doubts can fill a woman’s heart? You cannot understand
that at times I don’t know what I feel, nor what I think, nor what I would do. Do
you see, there is something in me, something that is incomplete. I am always in doubt.
I am always searching for something, and never feel certain of anything. I liked him.
Forgive me for telling you now. I liked him so very much, he was so good, and he would
have sacrificed his life for me. And there came a moment when I knew no longer whether
I liked him or not, when I even thought I cared for some one else, whilst all the
time I cared for none but him. And now I know it—now that it is too late, and now
that I have perhaps made him unhappy.”
</p>
<p>“Do you know that you have made him unhappy, Eline?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span></p>
<p>“No. I do not know, but I suspect it. At the Hague I did hear something about his
having got the better of his grief, but I could never believe it. Now that it is too
late I know all, and it is only now that I know how fond he was of me. Even if I were
to hear that he were married, I could not believe that he had quite forgotten me.
It cannot be! He must think of me as I often think of him.”
</p>
<p>“Do you still care for him?” he asked in a dull voice.
</p>
<p>“Not as I have cared for him, not now, Lawrence. I believe just now it is only pity
I feel for him, but I often think of him. Here is his portrait.”
</p>
<p>She opened the locket, and showed him Otto’s likeness. Without saying a word he gazed
at it.
</p>
<p>“Do you always carry this about with you?” he softly asked.
</p>
<p>“Yes,” she whispered, almost inaudibly, “always. To me this is sacred, and therefore,
Lawrence, therefore it can never be. The thought of him would always rise up between
us. With you I could be happy if that memory did not always haunt me. But for me to
be happy whilst I continually remembered that his life was so wretched—oh! it would
be impossible.”
</p>
<p>He did not answer, and she began to sob violently. She sank down on the ground, and
laid her head on his knee.
</p>
<p>“Oh, forgive me, Lawrence, forgive me. I never thought that you could care for me.
I was so ill, I was always coughing, I felt myself so weak. I thought that I had grown
out of it, that I should even have repelled a man. Had I not thought thus I should
never have allowed you to see that I cared for you. At first you spoke as if we were
brother and sister. Why did you not continue to speak thus? As it is, now I have been
compelled to cause you pain; I could not help it. I should have been wicked if I could
have become your wife without a feeling of remorse.”
</p>
<p>He lifted her up gently, and drew her towards him a little.
</p>
<p>“Eline,” said he, “one day you told me that you had thrown away your happiness. Then
I did not ask you what you meant by it, but now I ask you, do you mean by that the
letter which you sent to Otto?”
</p>
<p>“Yes,” she sobbed.
</p>
<p>“With that letter you threw your happiness away, you say? Are you certain now that
you are not throwing away your happiness for <span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>the second time, or can I never make you happy? It is Otto alone who can do that?”
</p>
<p>She looked at him with a melting expression in her eyes.
</p>
<p>“Oh, Lawrence,” she murmured passionately, her head nearly on his bosom, “if I had
but met you before—before all that had happened, I could not have cared for any one
but you. But it could not be. It was my fate.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, do not speak about fate. Fate is but a phrase. Every one makes his own fate.
You—you are too weak to make one for yourself. Let me make your fate for you.”
</p>
<p>“It cannot be,” she sobbed, and shook her head, which was nestled against him, hither
and thither. “It can never be.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, Eline, it can be,” he answered. “You say you could not have cared for any one
but me had you seen me sooner. Perhaps in that case I might not have cared for you;
however, these are suppositions which do not concern you in the least. All I know
now is, that I like you as you are. You say that you are ill, but I know that you
will be well again, I feel it.”
</p>
<p>“That is no certainty,” she wept.
</p>
<p>“That is true, but no more is it a certainty that you have made Otto unhappy. You
feel that too, do you not? You are not certain of it.”
</p>
<p>“No, no, I believe I am certain.”
</p>
<p>“No, you are not,” he continued; “and you tell me, now that I ask you to be my wife,
that it cannot be, that it can never be. Is that not cruel of you?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, why do you reproach me with that?” she sobbed.
</p>
<p>“Just now you said yourself that you were always in doubt—that you were always searching
for something, but that you never knew anything for certain. How is it then that now
you say you know without doubt that it never could be? Are you so certain of that?
Will you feel no regret when I am gone—when it is too late?”
</p>
<p>“Oh,” she groaned, “how can you make me suffer thus? You torture me.”
</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, and gently raised her head from his bosom.
</p>
<p>“I shall torture you no longer, Eline. Only this I want to say to you. Don’t refuse
now what I have asked you. A day may come when you may wish that you had spoken differently.
Let <span class="pageNum" id="pb297">[<a href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>me hope as much as that, at least. The day after to-morrow I am leaving here with
Vincent. In five months’ time I shall see you once again. I shall ask Vincent to write
you now and then. You shall always know where we are, and you need but say one word,
and I shall return at once. I don’t ask you now to promise me anything, but pray refuse
me nothing either<span class="corr" id="xd31e5241" title="Not in source">.</span> Allow me to hope, and endeavour to hope yourself. Will you do this, or is it too
much that I am asking you?”
</p>
<p>“No,” she whispered. “Oh, no, it is not too much. I will give you my answer in five
months’ time.”
</p>
<p>“Very well,” said he. “I shall ask you nothing more, and now I shall wait until your
uncle and aunt are home to take leave of them. Vincent will come to-morrow. But now
that we are alone, may I take my leave of you?”
</p>
<p>She did not answer, but looked at him. He pressed her in his arms and kissed her.
</p>
<p>“In five months’ time then?” he whispered with a smile.
</p>
<p>She raised herself up, looked at him fixedly, and then flung her arms round his neck.
And she kissed his forehead with a long passionate kiss.
</p>
<p>“In—in five months,” she murmured in reply.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Uncle Daniel and Aunt Elise were not a bit surprised when Eline, a few days after
St. Clare’s and Vincent’s departure, told them that she intended to return to the
Hague. They knew how capricious Eline was, how she longed, now for this and now for
that, and never was contented. But this time it was not out of caprice that Eline
longed for another dwelling-place. After the <i lang="fr">soirée</i>, at which St. Clare had asked her somewhat brusquely how she got there, it seemed
to her as if a veil had risen before her eyes, as if suddenly it was made plain to
her that she was <span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>not in her place with her uncle and aunt, and especially in their coterie, and it
was out of respect, out of friendship, perhaps out of love for St. Clare, that she
determined to leave her Brussels acquaintances.
</p>
<p>She wrote to Henk and asked him to take two rooms for her in a ladies’ boarding-house
or in one of the new stately hotels. In reply she received letters from Henk, from
Betsy, from old Madame van Raat, all of whom begged her not to go into apartments,
but to make her home with them. Betsy wrote her that she forgave and forgot everything
that had happened, if Eline on her part would also forgive and forget, and implored
Eline not to be so eccentric as to go and live by herself when there was room for
her in her sister’s house. Old Madame van Raat, too, wrote very urgently and very
affectionately, but Eline refused with repeated professions of gratitude; she was
determined that no one should make her change her mind.
</p>
<p>Henk, therefore, with a dejected face, shrugged his shoulders, and with Betsy he chose
two handsome apartments in a large pension on the Bezuidenhout. Thereupon Eline came
to the Hague.
</p>
<p>She recollected how the previous summer, worn-out with her wandering, she had come
to the Hague to make her stay with Madame van Raat. She compared her languor of those
days with the exhaustion which now, as it were, was surely undermining her, and she
did not even feel strength to weep about it. For the sake of her regard for St. Clare,
she had concentrated the last lingering remnants of strength to be once more as she
had been—winning, amiable, if not brilliant; and now that St. Clare was gone, she
discovered how, frank and natural as she had been towards him, she had for all that
involuntarily, as it were, excited herself so that she should not appear to him altogether
the utterly worn-out being, the living corpse that she was. Now that that excitement
was no longer necessary, she collapsed, broken down utterly. The emotion caused by
her latest confession, too, had greatly unnerved her, and it became to her a certainty
that she would never more be able to arouse herself from her physical exhaustion and
her moral inanition.
</p>
<p>Her cough was very violent, and Reyer attended her again, but she never told him about
her Brussels doctor, who had prescribed her the morphine-drops, as she remembered
that Reyer would never allow her to take an opiate. It was February, the cold was
<span class="pageNum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>intense, and she did not leave the house. When in the morning she rose, she felt as
formerly she had felt at Madame van Raat’s, too fatigued and languid to dress herself.
She wrapped herself in her peignoir and sank down on a couch. Then a delicious feeling
would come over her that she need not trouble herself about any one, that there was
no need for her to dress herself, and that she could remain as she was in her slippers
as long as she liked. Often Madame van Raat or Betsy, Madame Verstraeten or Marie
and Lili, found her thus undressed, dishevelled, vacantly staring out of the window.
She did not read, she did not do anything, and hour after hour passed by during which
she did not even think. At times she would suddenly throw herself on the floor, her
face pressed down on the carpet, and then it grew dark, oh, so dark around her, until
a knock at the door—the servant who brought her dinner—made her start up with a sudden
fright. Then she would sit down and eat a very little, and then a wan little smile
would hover around her lips, in which at once something satirical and something idiotic
were intermingled.
</p>
<p>The nights that followed on those days were for Eline veritable hours of terror. Everything
within her began to live, and she felt as if electrified by the horror, so that she
could not sleep. Her brain was in a mad whirl. Shrill, mysterious sounds rushed through
her ears. A very maelstrom of memories whirled round and round in her mind. Visions
of all shapes and forms rose up around her. She started in terror at everything—at
a shadow falling along the wall, at a pin glistening on the floor; then she took her
drops, and a dull sleep at last fell upon her like a leaden mantle.
</p>
<p>For minutes at a time she would stand staring in the glass at her faded features.
The tears would then start to her eyes, whose brightness was for ever extinguished,
and she thought of former days, she longed for that past again without really asking
herself what that past had been. For latterly she was no longer capable of continuous
thought. It was as if before her thoughts a barrier had been placed, which she could
not cross. But it was that very dullness which now overtook her that in some measure
lessened her melancholy, which, had her brain been of its normal clearness, would
certainly have risen to an unbearable crisis. But instead of that melancholy she now
struggled through hours of doubt, in which she was at a loss what to do with her useless
self, her useless existence, which dragged itself along within these four walls, with
<span class="pageNum" id="pb300">[<a href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>only her violent fits of coughing to break the weary monotony. Then she fell to weeping
bitterly about her unfulfilled desires, and she writhed on the ground, stretching
forth her arms towards an image which vaguely shaped itself to her eyes; for in her
dreams, as well as in her waking thoughts, the forms of Otto and St. Clare began to
be confused in her mind. The observations and sayings, the ideas of the one she ascribed
to the other, and she could no longer say which of them she had ever loved in truth,
or which of them she still loved. When, in such doubts, she attempted to continue
her train of thought, that impassable barrier stopped her, and her impotency enraged
her; with her clenched fist she beat herself on the forehead, as if therein there
was something broken that she <i>would</i> repair.
</p>
<p>“What can it be?” she would then ask herself in despair. “Why is it that I forget
so many things that have happened, and of which I can only remember that they have
happened? All that dullness here in my head! Rather the most horrible pain than that
dullness! It is as if I am going mad!”
</p>
<p>A shudder crept over her back like a cold snake at that thought. Suppose she were
to go mad, what then would they do with her? But she would not follow up such terrible
suppositions, although it seemed to her that if she could only think through that
spectre of rising insanity, she would suddenly pass over the barrier that had been
placed before her thoughts! But when once she should have passed into it, then—then,
indeed, she <i>would</i> be insane.
</p>
<p>At such moments she covered her face with her hands and pressed her fingers in her
ears, as though she <i>would</i> not hear, would not see; as if the first impression she would now receive would drive
her mad. And at that idea she was so terrified that she said not a word about that
dullness to Reyer.
</p>
<p>Her uninterrupted, listless idleness made her yield herself up entirely like a slave
to the strange fantasies and ideas which frequently rose to the most senseless ecstasies,
from which she suddenly awoke in dread terror; reclining on her couch, her fingers
nervously plucking at the tassels of the cushions, playing with the loose hair that
hung dishevelled about her head, her thoughts went back to her theatrical illusions
in the days when she had sung duets with Paul, and when she thought she loved Fabrice.
Then she became an actress; she saw the stage, the public, she smiled <span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>and bowed, flowers rained down upon her. Quite unconscious of herself, she would rise
from her couch, and with her broken voice softly hum a recitative, a phrase from some
Italian aria; and she moved about her room as if she were playing a part—she acted,
she stretched forth her arms in movements of despair, or lifted them up with longing
towards the fleeing lover; she sank down on her knees, and imagined that she was dragged
forward, although she prayed and implored for mercy. Various rôles rose confused in
her brain: Marguerite, Juliette, Lucia, Isabelle, Mireille—of all these in the space
of a few minutes she would go through the most tragic scenes, and suddenly, roughly
awakened from that madness, she would see herself once more alone in her room, and
making the strangest motions. Then she drew back in terror for herself, and tremblingly
she thought—
</p>
<p>“Heavens above! is it coming over me?”
</p>
<p>After such moments she would remain lying down staring about her with frightened eyes,
as if she expected that some crushing catastrophe would occur, as if the features
of the statuettes, the figures in the pictures and plates around her, would suddenly
come to life and laugh at her—a hard, grinning laugh, cruel as that of demons.
</p>
<p>After such a day she did her best in her silent terror to become herself once more.
In the morning, after awakening from her leaden, artificial sleep, she would quickly
get up, dress herself with much care, and go out shopping; then go and take coffee
with Henk and Betsy, with the Verstraetens, or with Madame van Raat. She complained
about her loneliness, and as, in such moments, she showed herself rather amiable,
they asked her here and there out of pity to stay to dinner. Then the evening would
pass cheerily enough, and she returned home, glad that another day was gone, but fainting
almost with fatigue at her unusual emotions by her artificially excited gaiety, unnatural
and full of shrill laughter, mingled with coughs. And such a day she had to pay for
dearly at night; the drops gave her no relief, she remained all through hopelessly
wide awake, struggling with horrible nightmares, haunted by spectres of her diseased
brain.
</p>
<p>Her acquaintances spoke a good deal about Eline, and Betsy frequently remarked with
a serious face that she feared it was far from right with her; Eline was so strange
just now, and Reyer was not satisfied either, and her acquaintances pitied her. Poor
Eline! <span class="pageNum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>formerly she was so pretty, so elegant, so cheerful—and now she was like a shadow
of her former self. Yes, indeed, she was very ill. That one could easily see.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>It was raining—a cold, searching March rain—and Betsy was at home, sitting in the
little violet boudoir which opened on the conservatory. It was somewhat dark, but
Betsy had moved her fauteuil in the light, and was reading <i lang="fr">Les Pêcheurs d’Islande</i> by Pierre Loti. But the book bored her; how could fishermen be so very sentimental?
Now and then her glance fell along the palms of the conservatory and on the barren
garden, where the bare branches were dripping with wet. Ben sat on the floor by her
fauteuil. All at once he gave a sigh.
</p>
<p>“What is it, Ben? Is anything the matter?” asked Betsy.
</p>
<p>“No, ma,” he answered, looking up in surprise with his laboured little voice.
</p>
<p>“Why do you sigh then, child?”
</p>
<p>“I don’t know, ma.”
</p>
<p>She looked at him searchingly for a moment, then she laid down her book.
</p>
<p>“Just come here, Ben.”
</p>
<p>“Where, ma dear?”
</p>
<p>“Here, on my lap.”
</p>
<p>He clambered slowly on to her lap and smiled. Lately her brusque voice often had something
soft in it when she addressed her only child.
</p>
<p>“Are you fond of your ma?” she asked caressingly.
</p>
<p>“Yes.”
</p>
<p>“Kiss me, then.”
</p>
<p>He flung his little arms round her neck.
</p>
<p>“Come, give me a kiss!”
</p>
<p>Still with the same listless little smile he kissed her.
</p>
<p>“Ma is never naughty to you, is she?” asked Betsy.
</p>
<p>“No.”
</p>
<p>“Will you stop with ma like that?”
</p>
<p>“Yes.”
</p>
<p>He nestled himself, the big boy of seven, against her bosom.
</p>
<p>“Tell me, Ben, is there nothing you would like? Would you not like something nice
of ma?”
</p>
<p>“No.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>“For instance, a little horse and carriage—a real horse, a pony? Then Herman can teach
you to drive.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, no, thank you,” he said, in a tone as if she bored him a little.
</p>
<p>She grew almost impatient, and was on the point of giving him a scolding, and telling
him that he was a wretch of a boy, but that impatience lasted only for a second. She
clasped him closer to her and kissed him.
</p>
<p>“But if there is anything you would like, you must tell me,” she said, almost weeping.
“Will you tell me, Ben? Say, child, will you really tell ma?”
</p>
<p>“Yes,” he answered, in a tone of great satisfaction.
</p>
<p>And she closed her eyes, shuddering at the thought that her child was an idiot. It
was like a curse that had come to her. But why, how had she then deserved it? What
had she done?
</p>
<p>She did not read further, and she kept him on her lap, where he lay quietly, with
his head resting on her shoulder, when she heard some one approaching through the
salon. It was Eline.
</p>
<p>“Good morning, Eline.”
</p>
<p>“Good morning, Betsy. Good morning, Ben.”
</p>
<p>“Fancy you going out in this rain!”
</p>
<p>“I had a cab. I could not stay at home any longer. The weather made me so melancholy,
and I thought I was going mad with <i>ennui</i>. Oh, great heavens!”
</p>
<p>She let herself go, as with a cry of despair she fell down on a seat, and removed
her little veil.
</p>
<p>“Just imagine always being pent up within the four walls of your room, no one to see
you, nothing in which you take any interest. Is that not enough to drive you mad?
At all events, I cannot bear it any longer, I shall certainly go crazy.”
</p>
<p>“Eline, <i lang="fr">prends garde, l’enfant t’écoute</i>.”
</p>
<p>“He—he does not understand that, and probably will never understand it,” she continued
in a hoarse voice. “Ben, come here; come here for a moment. Do you know what you must
do when you are big? Never think of anything, little man, whatever you do. Don’t think
at all. Eat, drink, and enjoy yourself as long as you can, and then—then—you must
marry! But you must not think, do you hear?”
</p>
<p>“Eline, <i lang="fr">vraiment tu es folle</i>,” cried Betsy hastily, fearing more for her child than for her sister.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span></p>
<p>Eline laughed loudly, and her laugh and the shrill words of her excited voice frightened
Ben. With his big eyes and his mouth wide open he stared at her. But still she laughed.
</p>
<p>“Oh, he does not understand anything of it, the little man. Eh, you don’t know what
it is that aunt is raving about, do you? But it is delicious to rave like that. I
wish I could do something very desperate, some awfully mad trick, something utterly
ridiculous, but I cannot think of anything. My mind is so dulled just now that I cannot
think. If only Elise were here she would know something. Do you know what we did one
day, Elise and I, the first time I stayed in Brussels? I never had the courage to
tell any one of it before, but now I dare say anything. Nothing troubles me now. Just
fancy, one evening we went out together for a walk, all alone, you know, just for
a little adventure. Don’t you say a word of it to any one, do you hear? Then we met
two gentlemen, two very nice gentlemen, whom we did not know at all. With them we
went for a drive—in an open landau, and then—then we went with them into a café.”
</p>
<p>Her story was continually interrupted by little nervous shrill laughs, and with the
last words she burst out into an uncontrollable fit of hysterical laughter. Not a
word was true of the whole story, but at that moment she believed in it herself.
</p>
<p>“Just fancy, in a café—in a café! And then——”
</p>
<p>“Eline, do pray stop that mad talk,” said Betsy softly.
</p>
<p>“Ah! I suppose you think it awfully shocking, eh? But rest assured, it was not quite
so bad as all that.”
</p>
<p>She still laughed, half weeping, and at last she burst out in hysterical sobs.
</p>
<p>“Oh, that wretched Reyer! I have always such a terrible pain here in my head, and
he does not care. He is always boring me about my cough. I know I cough—that is no
news; and oh, great heavens! it is so horribly dull in that Pension.”
</p>
<p>“Why don’t you come and stay with us then?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, that would never do. In three days’ time we should be pulling ourselves by the
hair,” laughed Eline boisterously. “Now that we see each other but rarely it is much
better.”
</p>
<p>“Really, I should do my very best to make you comfortable,” implored Betsy, who felt
terribly alarmed at Eline’s excited state. “We should have the greatest care for you,
and I should study you in everything.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb305">[<a href="#pb305">305</a>]</span></p>
<p>“But I should not study you. No, thank you very much. I value my liberty before everything.
How can you be so provoking? We should begin haggling at once. Why, we are haggling
now already.”
</p>
<p>“Why do you say that? I am not haggling at all. There is nothing I should like better
than for you to come here this evening, if you like.”
</p>
<p>“Betsy, now just leave off about it, or you will never see me again. I won’t live
with you any more. I <i>won’t</i>, so there! I’ve had enough of it.”
</p>
<p>And she hummed a tune.
</p>
<p>“Will you stay to dinner then this afternoon?” asked Betsy.
</p>
<p>“Rather! But I’m tired. You won’t find me very lively. What are you going to do this
evening?”
</p>
<p>“We are going to the Oudendykens’. Are you not invited?”
</p>
<p>“No. I never visit them.”
</p>
<p>“Why not?”
</p>
<p>“For my part they can frizzle themselves, the Oudendykens. Oh, my head—may I lie down
on a couch?”
</p>
<p>“Certainly.”
</p>
<p>“Then I shall go to Henk’s room. There is such a cosy sofa there.”
</p>
<p>“There is no fire there.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, that does not matter.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>She went up-stairs to Henk’s sitting-room. She lay down on the sofa, and ere long,
exhausted as she was with her excitement, sleep overtook her. She was aroused from
her slumbers by a heavy step on the landing. Before she was well awake, Henk entered.
</p>
<p>“Hullo, sissy, what have you been doing here in the dark? and how cold it is in here!”
</p>
<p>“Cold!” she repeated, with a look as that of a somnambulist. “Yes, now I feel it too.
I’m shivering—but I have been asleep.”
</p>
<p>“Come along down-stairs. Dinner will soon be ready. Betsy said you were going to stay;
aren’t you?”
</p>
<p>“Yes. Oh, Henk, how terrible that I have been asleep here!”
</p>
<p>“Terrible! Why?”
</p>
<p>“Now I won’t sleep to-night,” she screamed in despair, and she threw her head on his
shoulder and sobbed.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb306">[<a href="#pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Why don’t you rather come and stay with us again?” he asked softly. “You would be
so comfortable with us.”
</p>
<p>“No, not that.”
</p>
<p>“Why not?”
</p>
<p>“It would never do. I am certain of it. It is very kind of you, Henk, to ask me, but
it would not do. Sometimes I feel as if I could strike Betsy, and I feel that just
at the moment when she speaks nicely to me, as she did this afternoon, for instance.
I had to restrain myself with all my might from striking her.”
</p>
<p>He sighed, with a despairing face. To him she remained a puzzle.
</p>
<p>“Then let us go down-stairs,” said he.
</p>
<p>And as they were going down she leant heavily on his arm, trembling with the cold,
which only now she began to feel.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The winter went by, and Eline remained in the same condition.
</p>
<p>“Would it not do you good to go into the country in the summer?” asked Reyer. “I don’t
mean that you should travel from one place to the other, that would fatigue you too
much. But you might make a little stay in some quiet, cool spot amidst some cheerful
surroundings.”
</p>
<p>Her thoughts went back to the Horze. Oh, if she had been Otto’s wife, then grateful
coolness, shade, affection would have been hers.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know of such a place,” she answered languidly.
</p>
<p>“Perhaps I might know of something for you. I know some very nice kind people in Gelderland.
They have a little country seat surrounded by magnificent pine forests.”
</p>
<p>“In Heaven’s name,” screamed Eline passionately, “no pine forests!”
</p>
<p>“But country life would strengthen you.”
</p>
<p>“It is impossible to strengthen me. Pray, Mr. Reyer, let me lie where I am.”
</p>
<p>“Do you sleep better now?”
</p>
<p>“Oh yes, fairly well.”
</p>
<p>It was not true. She never slept at night, and by day she slumbered just a little,
she dozed just a little. The drops had no more effect, and only brought her into a
continual whirling ecstasy, a condition full of listlessness and terror, in which
she either <span class="pageNum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>raved like an actress, or dragged herself groaning along the floor. Reyer looked at
her penetratingly.
</p>
<p>“Miss Vere, pray tell me the truth. Are you in the habit of taking other medicines
than those which I prescribe?”
</p>
<p>“What makes you think that?”
</p>
<p>“Answer me the truth, Miss Vere.”
</p>
<p>“Of course not. How can you think such a thing? I should not have the courage to do
so. No, no, you may rest quite assured about that.”
</p>
<p>Reyer left, and in his carriage he forgot his note-book for a moment, and was deep
in thought about Miss Vere. Then he heaved a hopeless sigh. Scarcely had he left the
room when Eline rose. She was dressed only in a loose gray <span class="corr" id="xd31e5433" title="Source: pegnoir">peignoir</span>, which hung about her emaciated figure. In front of the glass, she plunged her hands
in her loose hair. It had grown very thin, and she laughed about it while the stray
locks fell about her fingers. Then she flung herself on the floor.
</p>
<p>“I won’t,” she stammered, “I will not see him any more, that Reyer. He makes me worse
than I am. I cannot bear him any longer. I shall write him to stay away.”
</p>
<p>But she did not feel sufficient energy to do so, and she remained lying on the floor,
and her fingers traced the figures of the carpet. Softly she began to hum to herself.
Through the door the sun cast a square golden glimmer on the floor, and thousands
of little dust particles danced about in the golden light. The glitter irritated Eline,
and she drew herself back.
</p>
<p>“Oh, that sun!” she whispered, with strange, big, dull eyes. “I hate that sun. ’Tis
rain and wind that I want—cold rain and cold wind—the rain that oozes through on my
chest, through my black tulle dress.”
</p>
<p>Suddenly she rose, and wrung her hands on her chest as though she would prevent the
wind from blowing open the cloak from her shoulders.
</p>
<p>“Jeanne! Jeanne!” she commenced in her delirium; “pray, pray take me in. I have run
away from Betsy, for she is unbearable. This evening, at the dinner at Hovel’s, she
said all kinds of nasty things about Vincent, and you know that I love Vincent; for
his sake I have broken my engagement, my engagement with Otto. Oh, how he bored me
with his eternal calmness, always calm—always calm! I—I shall go mad under all that
calmness; but <span class="pageNum" id="pb308">[<a href="#pb308">308</a>]</span>really, Henk, I shall go to Lawrence and ask his pardon. But don’t strike me, Henk!
Oh, Lawrence, Lawrence, I love you so! Do not be angry with me, Lawrence; see if I
do not love you! Here is your portrait which I always wear on my bosom.”
</p>
<p>She had knelt down by the sofa, and lifted up her face as if she saw somebody. All
at once she started in terror, and hastily, and with a shudder, she raised herself.
</p>
<p>“Great heavens! there it is coming again,” she thought, becoming once more conscious
of herself.
</p>
<p>There seemed to be a struggle going on in her brain, a struggle between her impotent
senses and her ever-increasing madness. With an uncertain movement she took up a book
which was lying on the table, and opened it, to force herself to be sensible and to
read. It was the score of <i lang="fr">Le Tribut de Zamora</i>, which she had once procured during her passion for Fabrice. She dared not look up,
fearing lest she might see her insanity take some hideous shape before her eyes. She
dared not move, out of terror for herself, and she would gladly have saved her fleeing
senses had she been able, as it were, to pass away out of her own self. And the ray
of sunshine once more filled the room, glowing over the satin of the curtains and
reflecting itself back in the china of the Japanese vases and the polished glittering
brass of the ornaments. Softly she began to sing something to herself, quite unconsciously,
in a voice hoarse and raw with endless coughing. Then there was a knock at the door.
</p>
<p>“Who is there?” she asked, alarmed.
</p>
<p>“’Tis I, miss,” cried a voice; “I’ve brought you your lunch.”
</p>
<p>“No, thank you, Sophie, I have no appetite.”
</p>
<p>“Will you not take anything, miss?”
</p>
<p>“No, thank you.”
</p>
<p>“Then you will ring, miss, when you want something, will you not?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, yes.”
</p>
<p>She heard the servant go down-stairs, she heard the tinkling of plates and glasses
on the tray. Eline gave another glance at the rôle of Xaïma, and she lifted her head
proudly and made an heroic motion with her hand, as she began to sing in a weak voice,
interrupted by coughing.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>At half-past five Sophie brought the dinner and laid the little <span class="pageNum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>round table with much care. But Eline scarcely touched any of the food, and she was
glad when Sophie took it back again. She took up a few cards which Sophie had brought
with her, cards from Madame <span class="corr" id="xd31e5468" title="Source: Vestraeten">Verstraeten</span> and from Lili.
</p>
<p>“Old Madame van Raat has also been here, and she went away.”
</p>
<p>Eline remained alone. The evening was falling, the sun was slowly sinking in the west,
but the light long remained. From her cupboard Eline took a little bottle and carefully
counted out some drops, which she let fall in a glass of water. Slowly she drank it.
Ah, if they would only bring her some relief! It had so often been in vain lately.
</p>
<p>She was tired after her long day of idleness and half-insane ravings, and she wanted
to retire to her rest at an early hour. No, she would not light the gas, she would
stay a little longer in the twilight, and then—then she would try to sleep. But it
all began to boil, to seethe, to throb in her head. She gasped for breath, and regardless
of the evening air which began to blow into the room, she let the gray peignoir glide
down from her shoulders. Her arms were thin, her chest was hollow, and she looked
at herself with a sad smile as her fingers passed through her thin hair. And because
it was growing dark, because in spite of her drops she would not sleep, because she
was very pale and white in the lace and the embroidery of her dress, because she grew
terrified at the increasing gloom, the madness once more returned—
</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ah, perfido! Spergiuro!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">she began as in a rage to hum to herself, as she lifted up her arm. It was the scene
of Beethoven in which Vincent used to smell the odour of vervain. In her song she
reproached a faithless lover with his broken troth, and her face expressed the most
tragic grief, a wounded love which would avenge itself. She told the lover to go,
but the gods above would crush him under their chastisement. Suddenly she snatched
from her bed a sheet, and she wrapped herself in the long white material, which in
the faint evening light fell about her like a cloak of marble.
</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Oh no! Fermate, vindici Dei!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">she sang hoarsely, and her voice broke into coughs, with melting eyes this time, for
in another mood she now invoked the mercy of the gods for the faithless one; however
he may have changed she <span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>remained the same, she wanted no revenge, she had lived and now she would die for
him. And slowly she murmured the <i lang="it">Adagio</i> slowly, very slowly, while the white folds of her drapery, with the imploring motions
which she made with her arms, rose and fell continually. Thus she sang on, on, until
a plaint forced itself from her throat, and in that plaint all at once she began to
act, as with the noble art of a <i lang="it">prima donna</i>. It seemed to her as though the lover had already fled, and as though she turned
to the chorus which surrounded her pityingly—
</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Se in tanto affa—a—a—anno!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">she murmured, almost weeping, in grief-stricken cadences, and her agony rose, the
plaint rose, and she shrieked higher and higher—
</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Non son degna di pieta!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">She started violently, terrified at the penetrating, shrill notes of her broken voice,
and she flung her sheet from her shoulders and sat down shivering. Would they have
heard her? she wondered. She just glanced through the open French window on to the
street. No, there were only a few people walking about in the growing darkness. But
in the house? Well, any way, she could not help it now. She would be sensible once
more. She sobbed, and yet she laughed. She laughed at herself. If she excited herself
like that she would never sleep. Suddenly she threw herself on her disarranged bed,
and closed her eyes, but sleep would not come.
</p>
<p>“Oh, heavens! Oh, great heavens!” she groaned. “Oh, great heavens, I pray you let
me sleep.”
</p>
<p>And she wept bitterly, continuously. Then a thought shot through her brain. If she
should drink a few drops more than the Brussels doctor had prescribed? Would it hurt
her? She thought not, because the dose she was in the habit of taking now gave her
no relief whatever. How many drops, she wondered, could she add to it without risk?
As many as she had taken already? No, that would be too many, of course. Who knows
what might happen? But, for instance, half as many again! Therefore, three drops more?
No, no, she dared not. The doctor had so urgently warned her to be careful. Still
it was very tempting, the few drops, and she rose. She took her little phial to count
the three drops. One—two—three—four—five—the last two fell into the glass before she
had time to take away the bottle. Five—that would be too <span class="pageNum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>many? She hesitated for a moment. With these five drops she would be <i>certain</i> to sleep. Still she hesitated, but all at once she came to a resolution, lured as
she was to it by the prospect of rest. And she drank.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>She laid herself down on the floor, close to the open French window. The cold perspiration
broke out all over her, and she felt a dullness stealing over her, but such a strange
dullness it was, quite different from what she usually felt.
</p>
<p>“Oh, great God!” thought she. “Have—have I taken too many?”
</p>
<p>No, no, that would be too terrible. Death was so black, so empty, so mysterious, but
still, if it were so? And suddenly her fears melted away into a restfulness immeasurable.
Well, if it were so she would not care. And she began to laugh with inaudible, nervous
little laughs, while the dullness descended upon her with a crushing weight as of
the heavy fist of a giant. With her hand she wanted to defend herself from those giant
fists, and her fingers became entangled in a cord about her neck. Oh, that was—that
was his portrait, Otto’s portrait. Could she indeed have taken too much? When to-morrow
came should she——? She shuddered. To-morrow morning would they knock at her door in
vain, and in the end would they find her lying there? A terrible thought indeed. She
was wet through with perspiration, and her fingers again wandered to the locket. No,
that portrait they should not find on her bosom. She raised herself up, and wrenched
the portrait out of the locket. She could no longer distinguish it, for it had grown
dark in her room, and in her eyes the light was already failing; only the yellow glare
of the street-lamp fell with a dull reflection into the room. But she saw the likeness
with her mind’s eye, with her fingers she touched the little piece of pasteboard,
and she kissed it, kissed it repeatedly.
</p>
<p>“Oh, Otto,” she faltered, in a heavy labouring voice; “you it was, you alone, my Otto,
not Vincent, not St. Clare, no one but you. You—oh, my Otto—oh, Otto—oh, great God!”
</p>
<p>And she struggled despairingly between the agony of death and a calm resignation.
Then, after covering the portrait with passionate kisses, she placed it in her mouth
despairingly without the strength left her to tear it up, or to destroy it in any
other way than by swallowing it. Thus, whilst a trembling gasp of breath shook <span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>through her whole frame, she chewed, chewed the discarded proof of the portrait—of
the portrait of Otto.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>She was weeping still, not with intermittent sobs, no longer with any bitterness,
but as a child, with soft, child-like little sounds, gently groaning, her bosom heaving
with faint, undulating motions. It was a weeping in which something like a little
laugh resounded, a little laugh of insanity. Then she grew quiet, and she nestled
herself with her head in her arms, still on the floor by the open window. She never
moved, desperate with terror at her surroundings, desperate with terror at what was
to come. It seemed to her as if throughout her frame there foamed and seethed a dark
and stormy sea, which engulfed every thought in her brain, and into which she gradually
sunk away. And with all her last remaining energy she tried to struggle against that
sea, but its pressure was too heavy, and she fell, fell back utterly exhausted, utterly
unnerved, hopelessly dulled by a stormy hissing in her ears and in her brain.
</p>
<p>“Great God! great God!” she groaned in a voice that was growing weaker and hoarser
with every moment, a voice full of a wild despair that had no longer the power of
utterance. Then, drop by drop, slowly and gently, her consciousness flowed away, and
she slept—the sleep of Eternity!
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The street-lamp was extinguished, and the big room was now dark as a grave. A mausoleum
of impenetrable blackness in the midst of which, white and shadowy, lay a corpse.
Then the chillness of the night entered into the apartment, and slowly the pearl gray
mist of daybreak arose to dispel the heavy gloom.

</p>
<p>A brilliant book, picturing English sights, society, customs, and amusements, as seen
by an unconventional and witty observer. The same qualities which made “A Social Departure”
so remarkable a success will make “An American Girl in London” a book which is “talked
about everywhere.”
</p>
<p class="adReview">“In the lighter literature of last year there was nothing more amusing than ‘A Social
Departure,’ by Sara Jeannette Duncan, of Canada. It was just long enough—it could
not well have been longer—but each reader wished that the author might write another
book in similar style. Well, she has done it, and she could not have taken a better
subject than ‘An American Girl in London.’ ”—<i>New York Herald.</i>
</p>
<p class="adReview">“The raciness and breeziness which made ‘A Social Departure,’ by the same author,
last season, the best-read and most-talked-of book of travel for many a year, permeates
the new book, and appears between the lines of every page. It is superfluous to say
that ‘An American Girl’ is ‘awfully fetching.’ ”—<i>Brooklyn Standard-Union.</i>

The work is distinguished by <i>verve</i>, by close and wide observation of the ways and cities of many men, by touches of
a reflection which is neither shallow nor charged with the trappings and suits of

</p>
<p class="adReview">“The home about which Dr. Abbott rambles is clearly the haunt of fowl and fish, of
animal and insect life; and it is of the habits and nature of these that he discourses
pleasantly in this book. Summer and winter, morning and evening, he has been in the
open air all the time on the alert for some new revelation of instinct, or feeling,
or character on the part of his neighbor creatures. Most that he sees and hears he
reports agreeably to us, as it was no doubt delightful to himself. Books like this,
which are free from all the technicalities of science, but yet lack little that has
scientific value, are well suited to the reading of the young. Their atmosphere is
a healthy one for boys in particular to breathe.”—<i>Boston Transcript.</i>

<p class="adReview">“ ‘Days out of Doors’ is a series of sketches of animal life by Charles C. Abbott,
a naturalist whose graceful writings have entertained and instructed the public before
now. The essays and narratives in this book are grouped in twelve chapters, named
after the months of the year. Under ‘January’ the author talks of squirrels, muskrats,
water-snakes, and the predatory animals that withstand the rigor of winter; under
‘February’ of frogs and herons, crows and blackbirds; under ‘March’ of gulls and fishes
and foxy sparrows, and so on appropriately, instructively, and divertingly through

</p>
<p class="adReview">“Mr. Ellwanger’s instinct rarely errs in matters of taste. He writes out of the fullness
of experimental knowledge, but his knowledge differs from that of many a trained cultivator
in that his skill in garden practice is guided by a refined æsthetic sensibility,
and his appreciation of what is beautiful in nature is healthy, hearty, and catholic.
His record of the garden year, as we have said, begins with the earliest violet, and
it follows the season through until the witch-hazel is blossoming on the border of
the wintry woods.… This little book can not fail to give pleasure to all who take
a genuine interest in rural life.”—<i>The Tribune</i>, New York.

<p class="adTitle"><i>MEMOIRS OF MADAME DE RÉMUSAT.</i> 1802–1808. Edited by her Grandson, <span class="sc">Paul de Rémusat</span>, Senator. 3 volumes, crown 8vo. Half bound, $2.25.
</p>
<p class="adReview">“Notwithstanding the enormous library of works relating to Napoleon, we know of none
which cover precisely the ground of these Memoirs. Madame de Rémusat was not only
lady-in-waiting to Josephine during the eventful years 1802–1808, but was her intimate
friend and trusted confidante. Thus we get a view of the daily life of Bonaparte and
his wife, and the terms on which they lived, not elsewhere to be found.”—<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Mail.</i>
</p>
<p class="adReview">“These Memoirs are not only a repository of anecdotes and of portraits sketched from
life by a keen-eyed, quick-witted woman; some of the author’s reflections on social
and political questions are remarkable for weight and penetration.”—<i>New York Sun.</i>
</p>
<p class="adTitle"><i>A SELECTION FROM THE LETTERS OF MADAME DE RÉMUSAT.</i> 1804–1814. Edited by her Grandson, <span class="sc">Paul de Rémusat</span>, Senator. 12mo. Cloth, $1.25.
</p>
<p class="adTitle"><i>MEMOIRS OF NAPOLEON, his Court and Family.</i> By the Duchess <span class="sc">d’Abrantes</span>. In 2 volumes, 12mo. Cloth, $3.00.
</p>
<p>The interest excited in the first Napoleon and his Court by the “Memoirs of Madame
de Rémusat” has induced the publishers to issue the famous “Memoirs of the Duchess
d’Abrantes,” which have hitherto appeared in a costly octavo edition, in a much cheaper
form, and in a style to correspond with De Rémusat. This work will be likely now to
be read with awakened interest, especially as it presents a much more favorable portrait
of the great Corsican than that limned by Madame de Rémusat, and supplies many valuable
and interesting details respecting the Court and Family of Napoleon, which are found
in no other work.

<p>RECENT FICTION.
</p>
<p class="adTitle"><i>FREELAND: A Social Anticipation.</i> By Dr. <span class="sc">Theodor Hertzka</span>. 12mo. Cloth, $1.00.
</p>
<p>A most interesting attempt to work out the social problems which confront the world
to-day. It is a description of an ideal community founded upon new and yet not impossible
conditions. In Germany this book has met with a success equal to that of <i>Looking Backward</i> in this country, and, like the latter book, it has led to the foundation of clubs
and societies, and to efforts to put the plans of the author into actual practice.
</p>
<p class="adTitle"><i>A MERCIFUL DIVORCE.</i> By <span class="sc">F.&nbsp;W. Maude</span>. 12mo. Paper, 50 cents; cloth, $1.00.
</p>
<p>A story of the modern “smart set” in London, by an author whose knowledge of the life
comes from actual experience. There has been no attempt at the sensational, but the
book represents an effort to picture a striking phase of modern society as it really
is.
</p>
<p class="adTitle"><i>AN UTTER FAILURE.</i> By <span class="sc">Miriam Coles Harris</span>, author of “Rutledge.” 12mo. Cloth, $1.25.
</p>
<p>“Rutledge” proved to be one of the most popular works of fiction ever published in
this country. The author’s host of friends will appreciate her skillful rendering
of this new and deeply interesting story.
</p>
<p class="adTitle"><i>STEPHEN ELLICOTT’S DAUGHTER.</i> By Mrs. <span class="sc">J.&nbsp;H. Needell</span>, author of “The Story of Philip Methuen,” etc. 12mo. Paper, 50 cents; cloth, $1.00.
</p>
<p class="adReview">“From first to last an exceptionally strong and beautiful story.”—<i>London Spectator.</i>
</p>
<p class="adReview">“Mrs. Needell has written nothing more absorbing or skillfully constructed than this
romance of English country life.… With that rare art in which art is concealed, her
creations have all the strong and weak attributes of our common humanity, be the social
scale high or low.”—<i>Leeds Mercury.</i>
</p>
<p class="adReview">“Deserves to be placed among the best and most artistic novels of the present season.”—<i>London Literary World.</i>
</p>
<p class="adReview">“Readers of Mrs. Needell’s works do not need to be told that she has done good work
before now, but it may be doubted whether she has done anything that will serve to
prepare them for a novel exhibiting such a combination of vigor and beauty as is to
be found in this book.”—<i>London Academy.</i>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
